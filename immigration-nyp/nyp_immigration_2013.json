    "2013 - 3699": "LAS VEGAS \u2014 Declaring \u201cnow is the time\u201d to fix broken immigration laws, President Barack Obama on Tuesday heralded a rare show of bipartisanship between the White House and Senate lawmakers on basic plans for putting millions of illegal immigrants on a pathway to citizenship, cracking down on businesses that employ people illegally and tightening security at the borders.But both the White House and Senate proposals for tackling the complex and emotionally charged issue still lack key details. And potential roadblocks are already emerging over how to structure the road to citizenship and whether a bill would will same-sex couples \u2014 and that\u2019s all before a Senate measure can be debated, approved and sent to the Republican-controlled House where opposition is likely to be stronger.Obama, in the heart of the heavily Hispanic Southwest, said Congress is showing \u201ca genuine desire to get this done soon.\u201d But mindful of previous immigrations efforts that have failed, Obama warned that the debate would become more difficult as it gets closer to a conclusion.\u201cThe question now is simple,\u201d Obama said during a campaign-style event in Las Vegas, one week after being sworn in for a second term in the White House. \u201cDo we have the resolve as a people, as a country, as a government to finally put this issue behind us? I believe that we do.\u201dDespite possible obstacles to come, the broad agreement between the White House and bipartisan lawmakers in the Senate represents a drastic shift in Washington\u2019s willingness to tackle immigration, an issue that has languished for years. Much of that shift is politically motivated, due to the growing influence of Hispanics in presidential and other elections and their overwhelming support for Obama in November.The separate White House and Senate proposals focus on the same principles: providing a way for most of the estimated 11 million people already in the U.S. illegally to become citizens, strengthening border security, cracking down on employers who hire illegal immigrants and streamlining the legal immigration system.A consensus around the question of citizenship could help lawmakers clear one major hurdle that has blocked previous immigration efforts. Many Republicans have opposed allowing illegal immigrants to become citizens, saying that would be an unfair reward for people who have broken the law.Details on how to achieve a pathway to citizenship still could prove to be a major sticking point between the White House and the Senate group, which is comprised of eight lawmakers \u2014 four Democrats and four Republicans.Obama and the Senate lawmakers all want to require people here illegally to register with the government, pass criminal and national security background checks, pay fees and penalties as well as back taxes, and wait until existing immigration backlogs are cleared before getting in line for green cards. After reaching that status, U.S. law says people can become citizens after five years.The Senate proposal says that entire process couldn\u2019t start until the borders were fully secure and tracking of people in the U.S. on visas had improved. Those vague requirements would almost certainly make the timeline for achieving citizenship longer than what the White House is proposing.The president urged lawmakers to avoid making the citizenship pathway so difficult that it would appear out of reach for many illegal immigrants.\u201cWe all agree that these men and women have to earn their way to citizenship,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for comprehensive immigration reform to work, it must make clear from the outset that there is a pathway to citizenship.\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t be a quick process, but it will be a fair process,\u201d Obama added.",
    "2013 - 4813": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama held a campaign-style rally in Las Vegas yesterday in his biggest attempt yet to muscle immigration reform through a divided Congress, saying that now is the time to act on an issue that went nowhere in his first term.Standing before a dozen US flags at a Vegas high school, Obama pointed to new movement in the Senate as cause for optimism, a day after a bipartisan group of senators released a plan with a \u201cpath to citizenship\u201d directly linked to border-security improvements.\u201cThe time has come for common-sense, comprehensive immigration reform. The time is now,\u201d Obama told the crowd invited by the White House.Obama campaigned on the issue last year, promising to push it during the first year of his second term. His proposals aren\u2019t new \u2014 he laid them out in a similar speech last year.But the new push marks the first time that Obama is putting his shoulder fully to the wheel in an attempt to get something through Congress.The president took executive actions during his re-election campaign to give thousands of young people who came here illegally as minors a chance to apply to stay \u2014 a move that helped him win over Latino voters in droves.Yesterday, Obama rolled out four general principles of reform: undocumented immigrants must \u201cearn their way\u201d to citizenship; the immigration system must be streamlined, border enforcement must be strengthened, and officials must crack down more forcefully on companies that knowingly hire illegal immigrants.Obama said the 11 million undocumented immigrants here \u201caren\u2019t looking for any trouble.\u201dThe White House tried to downplay the main split in a new compromise reached by the Senate\u2019s \u201cGang of 8\u201d \u2014 four Republicans and four Democrats. Republicans in the group added the condition that the path to citizenship would come only after the border is secured. The Obama plan calls for both goals, but with no linkage.\u201cGang\u201d member Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said yesterday it would be a \u201cterrible mistake\u201d to allow a path to citizenship without locking in security gains.\u201cFor the president to try to move the goal posts on that specific requirement, as an example, does not bode well in terms of what his role\u2019s going to be in this or the outcome,\u201d Rubio fumed on Fox News. He warned: \u201cIf that\u2019s not in the bill, I won\u2019t support it.\u201d Even if pro-reform forces push a bill through the Senate, it could get picked apart in the House, where some critics are already labeling it \u201camnesty.\u201d<strong>CASE STUDY #1</strong>\nBusinesswoman Martha Guolotuna, 53, left behind three children \u2014 the youngest, a son just 11 months old \u2014 when she departed Quito, Ecuador, for a new life in the United States 18 years ago.\u201cIf I was granted legal status, the first thing I would do is hop on a plane and see my children,\u201d she said. \u201cMy youngest was just a baby when I left and I haven\u2019t seen him since.\u201cLife has been good here. I own Emanuel Corporation Body Shop in Willets Point, Queens. But I need to get a driver\u2019s license to really run my business \u2014 and I can\u2019t because I\u2019m not legal. I want to stop living in the shadows and be treated like everyone else.\u201d \u201cI like what the president said,\u201d Guolotuna added after watching Obama\u2019s address at a high school in Las Vegas. \u201cI pay my taxes; my family and others deserve this.\u201d<strong>CASE STUDY #2</strong>\nYenny Quispe, 21, has been in America for 10 years after fleeing Peru with her mother and brother to escape her abusive father.She wanted to hear a lot more from President Obama in his Las Vegas speech.\u201cI was expecting more details from the president about what his plan was and what Congress was talking about,\u201d Quispe said. \u201cI just hope that this time will be different because we\u2019ve been waiting a long time,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope this will benefit everyone, not just farmers.\u201dQuispe got her residency card just two days ago but the rest of her family remains undocumented.\u201cRight now I\u2019m still scared that my mother and brother could be deported,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd what would I do with them? They\u2019re my family.\u201d<strong>CASE STUDY #3</strong>\nTania Gordillo, 43, came to the United States in 1995 from Ecuador and learned what it\u2019s like to be undocumented.She got a job as a seamstress but was fired because of her illegal status, she said.\u201cI\u2019m tired of constantly looking over my shoulder and living in fear that immigration officials will come knocking on my door and deport me and my husband,\u201d she said.\u201cI have a family here and I had to move three times because they wanted to deport us. Once they missed us by one day,\u201d she said.She said she liked what she heard from President Obama, agreeing that the time has come for immigration reform.\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting 18 years to get my legal status,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen my mother in 18 years and I really would like to see her.\u201dBy Lorena Mongelli",
    "2013 - 1664": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In a warning to fellow Republicans, Sen. John McCain said Wednesday that failure to pass comprehensive immigration legislation could mean continued election losses for the GOP and cause Republican-friendly states like Arizona to fall to the Democrats.The Arizona Republican, his party\u2019s former presidential nominee and one of eight senators to sign onto a bipartisan immigration reform framework this week, said failure to act means the trend of Hispanic defections from the GOP would continue.Latino voters supported President Barack Obama over Republican Mitt Romney 71 percent to 27 percent in November, helping to ensure Obama\u2019s victory.McCain said that Republicans have failed to understand the importance of immigration to Hispanic voters and that\u2019s cost the party at the ballot box.\u201cIf you have a large bloc of Americans who believe you\u2019re trying to keep their \u2026 fellow Hispanics down and deprive them of an opportunity, obviously that\u2019s going to have an effect,\u201d McCain said.The Senate framework would provide a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants already in the country, secure the border, attempt to simplify legal immigration, and add requirements for employers to prevent hiring of illegal immigrants.If no bill passes, McCain said, the forecast for Republicans is that \u201cthe trend will continue of lack of support from Hispanic voters, and also as you look at the demographics of states like mine that means that we will go from Republican to Democrat over time.\u201dMcCain spoke alongside Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, his partner on the immigration proposals, at a breakfast hosted by Politico.",
    "2013 - 1312": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Just a day after President Obama flew to Las Vegas to make a push for immigration reform, Republicans working out a bipartisan plan slammed the White House for an overreach that could kill the prospects for a new law.Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a key negotiator on a failed immigration plan during the Bush administration, yesterday warned that Obama could sink immigration reform by including provisions that provide gays with the right to bring their long-term partners under an expanded \u201cpath to citizenship.\u201d\u201cIf you are going to load it up with social issues, that is the best way to derail it,\u201d McCain told a Politico breakfast yesterday.Fellow negotiator Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) was even more blunt. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just put legalized abortion in there and round it all out?\u201d Graham sarcastically told reporters.Meanwhile in the House, conservative Republicans are griping about the amnesty proposal and have even started their own committee behind closed doors to craft an entirely different plan, according to Politico.com.But an optimistic Obama vowed to find consensus and said an agreement could be sealed within six months. \u201cI can guarantee that I will put everything I have behind it,\u201d the president said in an interview with the Spanish-language TV network Telemundo.<author></author>",
    "2013 - 1006": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid yesterday threw his support behind New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, a fellow Democrat under fire for his chummy relationship with a longtime donor. \u201cI have confidence he did nothing wrong, but that\u2019s what investigations are all about,\u201d Reid (D-Nev.) said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d Menendez took free rides to the Dominican Republic on the private plane of Dr. Solomon Melgen, a South Florida eye surgeon, in 2010. Senate ethics rules require that such trips be paid for or declared as gifts. Menendez\u2019s office said it reimbursed Melgen $58,500 for the trips \u2014 but only recently, two years after the fact. The FBI raided Melgen\u2019s West Palm Beach office last week. Reid called Menendez an important figure on Capitol Hill. \u201cHe was a leader in the House. He\u2019s been a leader in the Senate. He\u2019s chairman of [the Foreign Relations Committee] . . . And he is also an integral part of what we do with immigration reform,\u201d Reid said.\u201cSo I have the utmost confidence in him.\u201d",
    "2013 - 1767": "Call it \u201cBad Toy Story\u201d.Federal agents in New York today arrested five people on charges of importing hazardous and counterfeit toys from China \u2013 among them knock-off products emblazoned with images of popular film and TV characters, such as Spiderman, SpongeBob SquarePants, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Tweety Bird, and Mickey Mouse, officials said.Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents say those charged live primarily in Queens and they were charged with importing and trafficking hazardous toys in violation of the US Consumer Product Safety Act.Brooklyn federal prosecutors say that over the past six years, the toys were illegally shipped from China to New York City, where various companies sold them from a storefront and warehouse in Ridgewood, Queens, as well as at additional retail locations in Brooklyn and Queens.Some smuggled toys also featured unlicensed images of other pop culture icons, such as Winnie the Pooh, Dora the Explorer, Betty Boop, as well characters from Cars, High School Musical, and Toy Story, officials said.During searches this morning of a warehouse and two residences, agents seized several bank accounts and confiscated a Porsche and Lexus, which the feds say were paid for by sales of the dangerous toys.\u201cFor years, the defendants sought to enrich themselves by importing and selling dangerous and counterfeit children\u2019s toys without regard for the law or the health of our children,\u201d said Loretta Lynch, US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York.\u201cProfits from the counterfeit items, as well as toys riddled with lead and choking hazards, went to provide the defendants with luxury cars,\u201d Lynch said.Those charged are scheduled to be arraigned this afternoon in Brooklyn federal court.<em>mmaddux@nypost.com</em>",
    "2013 - 5756": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Barack Obama will focus his State of the Union address on boosting job creation and economic growth at a time of high unemployment, underscoring the degree to which the economy could threaten his ability to pursue second-term priorities such as gun control, immigration policy and climate change.Obama also may use Tuesday\u2019s prime-time address before a joint session of Congress to announce the next steps for concluding the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan by the end of 2014.Obama\u2019s State of the Union marks his second high-profile speech to the nation in about three weeks, after his inaugural address Jan. 21 that opened his second term. White House aides see the two speeches as complementary, with Tuesday\u2019s address aimed at providing specifics to back up some of the Inauguration Day\u2019s lofty liberal rhetoric.The president previewed the address during a meeting Thursday with House Democrats and said he would speak \u201cabout making sure that we\u2019re focused on job creation here in the United States of America.\u201d Obama said he would try to accomplish that by calling for improvements in education, boosting clean energy production, and reducing the deficit in ways that don\u2019t burden the middle class, the poor or the elderly.While those priorities may be cheered by some Democrats, they\u2019re certain to be met with skepticism or outright opposition from many congressional Republicans, especially in the GOP-controlled House. The parties are at odds over ways to reduce the deficit. Republicans favor spending cuts; Obama prefers a combination of spending cuts and increasing tax revenue.The president said he would address taxes and looming across-the-board budget cuts, known as the sequester, in the speech. The White House and Congress have pushed back the automatic cuts once, and Obama wants to do it again in order to create an opening for a larger deficit reduction deal.\u201cI am prepared, eager and anxious to do a big deal, a big package that ends this governance by crisis where every two weeks or every two months or every six months we are threatening this hard-won recovery,\u201d he said last week.The economy has rebounded significantly from the depths of the recession and has taken a back seat for Obama since he won re-election in November. He\u2019s instead focused on campaigns to overhaul the nation\u2019s patchwork immigration laws and enact stricter gun control measures following the massacre of 20 schoolchildren in Newtown, Conn., in December.The president also raised expectations for action this year on climate change after devoting a significant amount of time to the issue in his address at the inauguration.But the unemployment rate is persistently high at 7.9 percent, economic growth slowed last quarter and consumer confidence is falling, so the economy could upend Obama\u2019s plans to pursue a broader domestic agenda in his final four years in office.Tony Fratto, who worked in the White House during President George W. Bush\u2019s second term, said Obama has to show the public that he\u2019s still focused on the economy before he can get their full support for his other proposals.\u201cWe\u2019re not in a position where he can blame anybody else for the economy now,\u201d Fratto said, \u201cNow it\u2019s his economy.\u201dObama is expected to use his address to press lawmakers to back his immigration overhaul, which includes a pathway to citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants, and his gun control proposals, including universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons.Voting rights groups expect the president to call for changes that would make it easier for people to vote.\u201cI think it\u2019s important to be able to do more than one thing at a time,\u201d said David Axelrod, who served as senior adviser in the White House and Obama\u2019s re-election campaign. \u201cBut the economy is an ongoing and significant challenge that you have to keep working on.\u201dWhile the centerpiece of Obama\u2019s address is expected to be his domestic agenda, the president sees a chance to outline the next steps in bringing the protracted war in Afghanistan to an end. He\u2019s facing two pressing decisions: the size and scope of the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan after the war formally ends late next year, and the next phase of the troop drawdown this year.More than 60,000 U.S. troops are in Afghanistan.The president could update the public on cuts to the number of U.S. nuclear weapons, a priority for his administration. Vice President Joe Biden recently told a security conference in Germany that Obama probably would use the State of the Union to discuss \u201cadvancing a comprehensive nuclear agenda to strengthen the nonproliferation regime, reduce global stockpiles and secure nuclear materials.\u201dWhite House allies are nudging Obama\u2019s team to move forward on a plan to expand education for children before they enter kindergarten. They are reminding Obama\u2019s political aides that female voters gave the president a second term, serving up a 10-point gender gap.Obama carried 55 percent of female voters, many of whom are looking to the White House for their reward. While groups such as Latinos and gays have seen policy initiatives since Election Day, women\u2019s groups have not received the same kinds of rollouts.Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a rising Republican star and potential 2016 presidential candidate, will deliver the GOP response following Obama\u2019s address to Congress.The president will follow up his speech with trips across the country to promote his calls for job creation. Stops are planned Wednesday in Asheville, N.C., and Thursday in Atlanta.Obama\u2019s speechwriters started working on the speech shortly after the Nov. 6 election. The process is being led for the first time by Cody Keenan, who is taking over as the president\u2019s chief speechwriter.",
    "2013 - 6903": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The American public will get a competing mix of rhetoric and imagery in President Obama\u2019s State of the Union address Tuesday, a speech that offers a heavy dose on the economy even as it plays out against a visual backdrop dominated by the current national debate over guns.With the economy still trying to find its footing and with millions still out of work, Obama will make a case for measures and proposals that he says will boost job creation and put the economy on a more upward trajectory. Obama\u2019s emphasis underscores a White House recognition that while the president seeks to expand his agenda and build a second-term legacy, the economy remains a major public preoccupation.But in the galleries above the rostrum of the House of Representatives where Obama will speak, many of the faces looking down on him will be those of Americans thrust into the politics of gun violence.First lady Michelle Obama will sit with the parents of a Chicago teenager shot and killed just days after she performed at the president\u2019s inauguration. Twenty-two House members have invited people affected by gun violence, according to Rep. Jim Langevin, D-R.I., who pushed the effort. And Republican Rep. Steve Stockman of Texas says he\u2019s invited rocker Ted Nugent, a long-time gun control opponent who last year said he would end up \u201cdead or in jail\u201d if Obama won re-election.That confluence of message and symbolism illustrates where Obama is in his presidency following his re-election.The economic blueprint he will discuss will have many of the elements Americans have heard before, with its embrace of manufacturing, energy development and education. And in that sense it is a reminder of what was unfulfilled at the end of Obama\u2019s first term. But the tragic murders of 26 people at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school in December altered the president\u2019s agenda, pushing guns onto a to-do list that already included a new push for an overhaul of immigration law.As the president addresses gun violence, the cameras are sure to pan the faces in the crowd inside the House chamber, each with a story meant to influence the debate. Obama has proposed a ban on certain weapons and on high-capacity ammunition magazines. He has also called for broader, universal background checks on gun purchasers, a proposal that stands a better chance politically.Domestic policy will be front and center, but ongoing challenges abroad won\u2019t go without mention. On North Korea, which said it successfully detonated a nuclear device Tuesday in defiance of UN warnings, the White House said Obama would make the case that the nuclear program had only further isolated the impoverished nation.\u201cThe president will say that the only way North Korea will rejoin the world community is if they stop these threats and live up to their international obligations,\u201d said Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for the White House\u2019s National Security Council.But White House aides say the economy is still Obama\u2019s central theme.\u201cYou\u2019ve seen the president act aggressively on comprehensive immigration reform. You\u2019ve seen the president put forward a series of comprehensive proposals to reduce gun violence in this country in the recent weeks,\u201d White House press secretary Jay Carney said Monday. \u201cThese are important priorities of the president and of the nation. But what remains his No. 1 priority is what it has been since he took office, which is to get this economy growing, get it creating jobs, strengthening the middle class and expanding the middle class \u2014 allowing those who seek and aspire to the middle class to get there, giving them the tools to do that.\u201dSenior White House adviser Valerie Jarrett said \u201cthe president has always believed that our country is strongest when we build from the middle out, not from the top down.\u201dShe said in an interview that the president\u2019s \u201cconfidence has grown\u201d over the past four years and he is optimistic that his programs can be approved.Jarrett said Obama remains interested in a deal with Republicans to avoid automatic budget cuts on March 1 and said he and House Speaker John Boehner had been \u201cjust moments apart\u201d from striking a large-scale agreement on taxes and spending at the end of last year, but that the Ohio Republican couldn\u2019t sell it to his party\u2019s House caucus. Boehner\u2019s office denies that characterization of the talks.The renewed emphasis on job creation will dominate the message that Obama will take to the road in the days after his speech, pushing his economic recovery proposals during stops in North Carolina, Georgia and his hometown of Chicago. Obama is expected to reiterate his calls for revitalizing the manufacturing sector; he pledged during his campaign that he would create 1 million new manufacturing jobs during his second term. Following a sluggish 2012, manufacturing grew at a faster pace last month, driven by an increase in new orders and more hiring at factories.His call for measures that prod the economy will play out as he presses Congress to avoid deep spending cuts that are scheduled to begin automatically on March 1. Obama wants instead a mix of tax revenue and cuts in spending that he has promoted as a \u201cbalanced\u201d approach to easing federal deficits.Obama has called for raising more revenue through ending tax breaks and closing loopholes, but he has not detailed a list of targets. He and his aides often mention as examples of unnecessary tax breaks a benefit for owners of private jets and tax subsidies for oil and gas companies. Such measures are modest, however. Ending the corporate plane and oil and gas breaks would generate about $43 billion in revenue over 10 years.That appeal for new revenue is getting stiff-armed by Republicans, who reluctantly agreed at the start of the year to increase tax rates on the wealthiest Americans in exchange for extending Bush-era tax rates for the rest of taxpayers.\u201cHe\u2019s gotten all the revenue he\u2019s going to get,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Monday. \u201cBeen there, done that.\u201dWith Republicans in control of the House and exerting influence in the Senate, Obama intends to employ all the tools at his disposal in an effort to win over the public to put pressure on Congress.The White House and Obama\u2019s allies are launching simultaneous social media, public outreach and fundraising campaigns tied to his State of the Union address. Those efforts were successful in his re-election campaign and Obama aides believe they could be as effective in pushing policies as they were in pushing his candidacy.\u201cHe\u2019s got to strike now,\u201d said presidential historian Allan Lichtman of American University, who believes the economy, the environment and long-term changes in federal entitlements are key to Obama\u2019s legacy. \u201cNext year he won\u2019t have the ear of the public in the same way he has this time.\u201dJarrett appeared Tuesday morning on \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d and NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show."
