    "2006 - 6345": "Plainclothes transit cops eating lunch in a Times Square diner \u2013 agog as a dandily dressed Brooklyn man stuffed piles of cash from an ATM into a gym bag \u2013 ended up nabbing a key player in a $4 million international identity-theft ring.   What began as a hankering for grilled chicken could be the coffin nail for the ring that has ripped off countless consumers and banks.   Feds had been investigating the syndicate with little luck.   They knew people were stealing the bank and credit-card account information and PIN numbers of consumers from all over the United States and withdrawing money from their accounts.   They even had video of a guy using a swag card to withdraw money but couldn\u2019t ID him.   But a blue-plate special of a big break came on Thursday, during the lunch rush at Trolley\u2019s Restaurant on 42nd Street between Eighth and Ninth avenues.   The four Anti Crime cops came in and sat down at their usual table just after noon.   Shortly after the hungry men ordered \u2013 two grilled chicken salads, one sandwich special and a roast-chicken platter \u2013 they noticed the handsome, brown-haired man.   Andrei Potupa, 29, was wearing his expensive Hugo Boss blazer, stylishly paired with black jeans and sneakers.   But it wasn\u2019t the Bensonhurst man\u2019s natty clothes that caught their eyes.   The Russian immigrant was standing at the restaurant\u2019s ATM, inserting blank card after card and withdrawing handfuls of money at a time, police sources said.   \u201cThe minute he stopped, they went after him and grabbed him at the door,\u201d said Paul Vasiliadis, a Trolley\u2019s employee.   \u201cIt was an awful surprise [for him] when they got to the door and grabbed him. He was pale white.\u201d   Cops then rummaged through his bag and found stacks of $20 bills, Vasiliadis said.   He had 52 of the gray blank cards in the bag, along with $7,504 in cash.   With their lunches wrapped to go, the cops arrested Potupa and hauled him into nearby Midtown South station house \u2013 and quickly realized they\u2019d stumbled onto something big.   \u201cYou\u2019ve got to give them credit for being that observant,\u201d said Vasiliadis. \u201cIt\u2019s awesome. It\u2019s a scam that hurts people and I\u2019m glad they busted him.\u201d   The U.S. Secret Service quickly swooped in and revealed they\u2019d been tracking Potupa for a while in a joint probe with the FBI.   They pegged Potupa as a member of the international identity-theft ring and took over the investigation, the source said.   Potupa initially tried to say he\u2019d found the cards and was just checking them out, the sources said.   Cops gave the cards a scan on an NYPD computer and saw they were actually clones of stolen cards \u2013 complete with legitimate users\u2019 account information encoded on the magnetic strips, the sources said.   Faced with that incriminating information, Potupa changed his story and said he bought the cards online from a Canadian spammer.   A search of Potupa\u2019s home revealed another 105 of the cards, almost $70,000 in cash, electronics, a money counter, jewelry, receipts and addresses of banks, the source said.   And an inspection of his 2006 gray Porsche \u2013 parked in a lot half a block away from the restaurant \u2013 revealed a stun gun and an additional $497, the source said.   \u201cThe guy was a good tipper, four or five bucks a shot,\u201d the parking attendant remembered. \u201cOf course, he\u2019s <em>got</em> to tip, it\u2019s a Porsche.\u201d   The attendant said Potupa was a regular, and was shocked when cops came and impounded the car.   \u201cHe used to go and come back in an hour,\u201d he said.   Cops also confiscated Potupa\u2019s cellphone, which is rife with foreign phone numbers. Cops are working to trace those numbers.   Potupa broke down and confessed when he was shown the feds\u2019 video, which captured him emptying an ATM, a source said.   Cops said he\u2019s been hitting ATMs in diners, delis and bank branches with account information from unwitting victims, some as far away as the Midwest.   \u201cSomehow, he\u2019s managed to breach a security wall through computer wizardry,\u201d said the source. \u201cOr someone is selling him inside information.\u201d   Potupa has been living like a high-roller with his alleged ill-gotten gains.   He liked to travel, drive fast cars and hang around with gorgeous women.   Recently, he traded his 2004 silver Porsche for a brand new 2006 Cayenne that cost him $69,000. It was confiscated by cops.   And DMV records show his license plate \u2013 POTUPA \u2013 was attached to a 2001 BMW and a 2004 BMW before he upgraded to the Porsches.   \u201cOne day [Potupa and his girlfriend] just started driving really fancy cars,\u201d said a neighbor near his Bensonhurst apartment. \u201cThey drove around the fanciest cars in the neighborhood.\u201d   Another neighbor, Ozhan Tastaban, 16, said, \u201cI was wondering how he got all those nice cars. He just kept popping up with a new one.\u201d   His tastes in women also veered toward the deluxe.   \u201cHe had such beautiful girlfriends,\u201d said another neighbor, adding that he seemed completely trustworthy, bright and educated.   Neighbors believed he was a Russian-language TV journalist and his personal Web site shows photos of him in far-flung locales like Cambodia, Thailand and Turkey.   Among the hundreds of pictures are several of him with animals \u2013 holding a lizard, a turtle and a scorpion \u2013 and others of him wearing a Nazi helmet and leaning on an old U.S. jet fighter while in Vietnam. <em>Additional reporting by Philip Messing, Lorena Mongelli, and Jennifer Fermino</em><em>murray.weiss@nypost.com</em>  Scammers and skimmers   Andrei Potupa allegedly used a series of blank cloned credit cards he claims he bought over the Internet \u2013 for the rip-offs.   Here\u2019s how \u201cblank card\u201d scams work:   * Credit-card thieves install a skimmer (a battery-operated device available for $10 over the Internet) on an ATM.   * The skimmer records account information encrypted on the card\u2019s magnetic strip.   * At the same time, thieves use a tiny pinhole camera at the ATM to watch users keying in their PIN.   * Data obtained from the skimmer and the camera are stored on a computer. The scammers buy blank cards with magnetic strips and a commercial card writer.   * The financial information contained on the victim\u2019s card, as well as the PIN, is transferred to the magnetic strip when a blank card is swiped through the card writer.   * Thieves can now use a cloned card at any ATM and withdraw a victim\u2019s cash.

    "2006 - 10091": "Doctors tracking 9/11 rescue and recovery workers are studying whether the toxic air at the World Trade Center caused not only lung disease and possibly cancer \u2013 but also heart attacks, The Post has learned.   The death toll of the Ground Zero heroes \u2013 firefighters, cops, EMTs, construction workers, immigrant laborers and others \u2013 is climbing, and a growing number are dying of heart attacks and cardiovascular disease.   Researchers who have studied Ground Zero air samples \u2013 initially called \u201csafe\u201d by the EPA \u2013 are not surprised at illnesses surfacing in many who worked without respirators or safety suits at the hugely hazardous site.   \u201cThese people have been screwed,\u201d said Thomas Cahill, a scientist at the University of California-Davis who has studied the finely pulverized airborne poisons that WTC workers \u201cinhaled deep into the lungs\u201d for months.   \u201cThey\u2019re as much victims of 9/11 as those killed in the buildings.\u201d   Doctors monitoring 13,000 WTC workers are investigating a possible link between the heart problems and the respiratory ailments so common among the tens of thousands of Ground Zero workers and nearby residents.   \u201cThere is an increased risk of heart problems from lung disease,\u201d said Dr. Stephen Levin, of the WTC medical monitoring program at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in Manhattan.   \u201cThere is also evidence that people exposed to micro-fine particles -which was certainly the case at the World Trade Center \u2013 are at increased risk for heart disease.\u201d   Researchers will soon consult top cardiologists on possible blood tests to detect the hidden danger, Levin told The Post.   The new focus comes two weeks after James Doyle, 54, a retired transit worker from Staten Island, died of a heart attack.   Active and athletic before 9/11, Doyle developed lung disease after weeks of digging at Ground Zero and had to use an oxygen pump.   Last month, Kevin Lee, 31, a seemingly healthy NYPD cop, collapsed and died while chasing a suspect, raising questions about the effects of his many hours at Ground Zero.   And last June, Tim Keller, 41, an FDNY emergency medical technician and father of four, died of a heart attack after going on disability for post-9/11 asthma, bronchitis and pulmonary emphysema.   \u201cBy the end, he couldn\u2019t walk two steps without taking a breath,\u201d said his son David, 19.   \u201cOne day, he just went \u2013 his lungs stopped pumping enough blood into his heart.\u201d   Doctors told the family Keller\u2019s death was \u201cdirectly related to his days of search and rescue down at Ground Zero,\u201d the son said.   David Worby, a lawyer representing 6,000 WTC workers in a class-action lawsuit, said about six men in their 30s or 40s with no family history of coronary disease have died of heart attacks so far.   \u201cHundreds more will die prematurely,\u201d he predicted. \u201cThis is scratching the surface of all the diseases linked to these toxic exposures that people must be tested for and treated.\u201d   So far, at least 24 of the 6,000 workers have died from inhaling, ingesting or absorbing WTC dust and fumes \u2013 rife with thousands of pounds of pulverized mercury, lead, asbestos, dioxin, benzene, cadmium and PCBs, the suit argues.   The dead include men in their 30s, 40s and 50s from cancers of the esophagus, throat, pancreas, and kidney, Worby said.   Such cancers normally take years longer to develop, but Worby contends they struck sooner because of a \u201csynergistic effect\u201d of the deadly toxins \u2013 a theory Levin said is under study.   Others have died or suffer from lymphoma and leukemia \u2013 blood cancers that can develop several years after exposure to toxins.   After working 12-hour days for three months, digging for body parts and doing security at Ground Zero, NYPD detective Ernie Vallebuona, 40, is fighting lymphoma.   Since a recurrence, he has undergone a second round of chemotherapy and blood stem-cell transplants \u2013 and will learn this week whether it worked.   Weakness and fatigue after 9/11 \u2013 \u201cI couldn\u2019t pull my kids in a wagon to the beach\u201d \u2013 led doctors to discover a large mass in his abdomen.   The disabled vice cop, bald from the treatment and on many medications, is so vulnerable to deadly infection he can\u2019t eat out or play with his two sons.   He couldn\u2019t root for them at the recent Boy Scout Pinewood Derby because of the crowd.   \u201cIt breaks my heart,\u201d Vallebuona said. \u201cI\u2019m just holed up in the house. I feel like such a lump.\u201d   Fellow detective Rich Volpe, 38, \u201cspit up blood and black stuff from my lungs for months\u201d during 12-hour shifts at Ground Zero and the Fresh Kills landfill.   Volpe was diagnosed with kidney disease in 2002, and has lost 50 percent of function in both kidneys.   He will eventually need a transplant to survive. Doctors have told the bachelor he may never have kids.   Speaking between loud gasps and coughs, ironworker John Sferazo, 50, recalled inhaling \u201cgreen gases\u201d bubbling up from Ground Zero for 30 days after the terror attacks.   \u201cThere were times I couldn\u2019t wear any type of respiratory protection because the air was so bad you had to inhale whatever you could to try and pull some oxygen out of it,\u201d he said   Sferazo, a father of three, has lost a third of his lung capacity. Last week he attended the funeral of a fellow Local 361 worker and Ground Zero partner, Michael Kendrick, who died of lung cancer.   \u201cI saw his daughter kiss his corpse goodbye. It was tragic,\u201d he said.   While \u201ccancer is a continuing concern,\u201d among firefighters, cancer and heart attacks have not risen above normal since the terror attacks, said Dr. Kerry Kelly, the FDNY\u2019s chief medical officer.

    "2006 - 3358": "The thieving maid-to-the-stars \u2013 who brazenly swiped the $95,500 diamond earrings Robert De Niro gave his wife for their wedding \u2013 was sent up the river without a feather duster yesterday.   An angry judge sentenced sobbing Lucyna Turyk-Wawrynowicz, 35, to one to three years in state prison. Factoring in good behavior and time already served, the illegal immigrant could be shipped back to her native Poland by summer\u2019s end.   Meanwhile, cops have returned most of the jewelry, shoes, cameras and clothing stolen by the mendacious maid to their rightful owners, who include actress Candice Bergen and Renee Rockefeller, daughter-in-law of the late Nelson Rockefeller.   Turyk-Wawrynowicz confessed to cops that she didn\u2019t steal from client Isabella Rossellini, who was \u201cnice\u201d to her \u2013 but stole from the others because they were \u201cmean.\u201d   \u201cYou worked not only by cleaning and dusting . . . but by cleaning out the property of the various employers that you worked for,\u201d Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Renee White said in scolding the dastardly domestic.   \u201cYou violated the trust of five individuals by stealing significant property from these individuals,\u201d the judge told her.   Between 2001 and last year, the slippery Pole stole well over $100,000 in money and property from her well-heeled Manhattan clients. That included:   * The 11-carat diamond drop earrings De Niro gave his wife, Grace Hightower, for their wedding. Turyk-Wawrynowicz also took Hightower\u2019s shoes, dresses and belts. The thefts happened last spring, as the maid cleaned the couple\u2019s apartment at the Langham on Central Park West.   * A diamond engagement ring and earrings belonging to Rockefeller. Turyk-Wawrynowicz was working as a housekeeper at the Rockefellers\u2019 East 79th Street apartment.   * A more than $1,000 brown suede coat stolen two years ago from Bergen, along with several cameras and some $5,250 in unauthorized credit card charges at Gristedes, Costco, Gracious Home, and Barefoot Contessa.   When Bergen confronted her, the maid threatened, \u201cIf you have me arrested, I will go to the press and tell them the reason I was accused of these crimes is because your husband sexually harassed me and I refused his advances.\u201d   * Some 17 unauthorized charges in March 2001 at Barneys New York \u2013 for items including clothes by Prada \u2013 on the credit card of another employer, children\u2019s apparel store owner Denise Menton. Confronted, the maid said, \u201cI did not think that you would notice.\u201d   Turyk-Wawrynowicz was busted only after Hightower noticed her valuable earrings were missing and called the cops last June. The other victims came forward after the DA\u2019s office contacted them, or upon seeing news accounts of the arrest. Both De Niro and Bergen testified about the thefts before a Manhattan grand jury.

    "2006 - 3113": " WASHINGTON \u2013 Three Ohio men were indicted yesterday for plotting attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq, in a disturbing new case that revealed efforts by master terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi to recruit Americans to the global jihad.   Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez announced the indictment of three men who all lived in Toledo, including one man with American and Jordanian citizenship who is also accused of threatening to kill or maim President Bush.   \u201cThese defendants have been living in the U.S., where they have been engaging in weapons training and seeking help in order to kill people abroad, including our troops,\u201d Gonzalez said.   \u201cIndividuals who aid terrorists within our borders threaten the safety of all Americans,\u201d he added.   The indictment made repeated references to connections with \u201cmujahedeen brothers overseas,\u201d but did not specify which terrorist group they were connected to.   But U.S. counterterrorism officials told The Post the three men, who were arrested over the weekend, had been recruited by al Qaeda in Iraq, the bloodthirsty terror network headed by Zarqawi.   \u201cThis is a very serious case. We have known for quite a while that the Zarqawi network was recruit- ng among the immigrant Muslim population in Europe. But this is the first time we have seen it here in this country \u2013 so this is a little disquieting,\u201d said Vincent Canistraro, former CIA counterterrorism director.   The three terrorist wannabes were identified as Mohammad Zaki Amawi, 26, a U.S. citizen born in Jordan, Marwan Othman al-Hindi, 42, also a U.S. citizen born in Jordan, and Wassim Mazloum, 24 from Lebanon. They are charged with plotting to kidnap, kill and maim people in a foreign country, and face life in prison of convicted.   The indictment handed down by a federal grand jury in Cleveland yesterday outlined an elaborate plot dating back to November 2004 in which one man used an auto dealership and another formed a tax-exempt foundation to solicit government grants and private donations to fund their jihad activities.   The men were in touch with a former military trainer \u2013 who later turned informer \u2013 who helped them learn how to shoot guns at indoor ranges.   They also had videos on how to make suicide bomb belts and improvised explosive devices.   The feds also accused them in the indictment of attempting to purchase chemical agents and recruit others, whom Gonzalez did not identify, to fight U.S. troops in Iraq.   In one case, the men talked about practicing setting off explosives last July 4, using fireworks celebrations to cover the sound of their bombs going off. It is unclear whether they carried out that plan.   Amawi, who is also charged with discussing killing or injuring Bush, pleaded not guilty in Cleveland yesterday. The other two were also expected to be arraigned.   Mazloum is also accused of using a car dealership he runs with his brother as cover to travel to Iraq to learn how to build bombs with ordinary household items.   Hindi is accused of trying to get the military trainer to travel with him to the Middle East to set up a terrorism training center."
