    "2008 - 1137": "The Russian immigrant accused of gunning down a Forest Hills orthodontist traded 65 phone calls with the victim\u2019s estranged wife, prosecutors said yesterday.   The brother of slain dentist Daniel Malakov and others shouted in Russian at suspect Mikhail Mallayev, 50, being escorted from a Queens courtroom, where he was remanded without bail.   \u201cHang him up!\u201d yelled Gavril Molokov.   Other taunts included, \u201cShoot him!\u201d and \u201cTake off his head!\u201d   Mallayev \u2013 who had been extradited from Georgia \u2013 pleaded not guilty to the Oct. 28, 2007, shooting.   Just before he was killed, Malakov won temporary custody of the couple\u2019s only child, 4-year-old Michelle.   Malakov\u2019s family has insisted that his ex-wife, Dr. Mazoltuv Borukhova, is responsible for the slaying in front of the little girl.   \u201cI really think it\u2019s becoming more apparent it\u2019s her that hired him,\u201d said Gavril.   Mallayev has claimed the repeated phone calls were for medical advice Borukhova was giving him for his wife.   Mallayev\u2019s wife is a Borukhova relative.<em><a class=\"a10blb\" href=\"mailto:ikimulisa.livingston@nypost.com\">ikimulisa.livingston@nypost.com</a></em>",
    "2008 - 934": "The Republican battle to win the bare-knuckled South Carolina primary tomorrow is too close to call \u2013 with polls showing a dead heat between old war horse <a class=\"legacy-link\">John McCain</a> and former Baptist preacher Mike Huckabee.   The MSNBC/Mason-Dixon survey showed McCain with 27 percent support and Huckabee 25 percent \u2013 with 8 percent undecided.   The rest split for Mitt Romney, with 15 percent, Fred Thompson (13), Ron Paul (6) and Rudy Giuliani (5).   The Rasmussen daily tracking poll showed 24 percent each for Huckabee and McCain \u2013 with Romney and Thompson not far behind, with 18 and 16 respectively.   For McCain, the dead heat is particularly troubling. The Arizona senator and former Vietnam POW is fighting a barrage of negative phone calls to voters slamming him on explosive issues like abortion and immigration. <em><a class=\"a10blb\" href=\"mailto:carl.campanile@nypost.com\">carl.campanile@nypost.com</a></em>",
    "2008 - 1704": "COLUMBIA, SC \u2013 The only thing that could stop <a class=\"legacy-link\">John McCain</a>\u2018s \u201cStraight Talk Express\u201d at this point is the little, white \u201cAmnesty Truth Express\u201d van that\u2019s following his bus around as he campaigns in this highly conservative state.   \u201cGet <a class=\"legacy-link\">John McCain</a> to give you some real straight talk! Ask him why he wants to give amnesty to 12 million illegal aliens,\u201d shouts a man with a sign standing in the rain outside a McCain rally here yesterday.   Supporters of the Arizona senator listen to the rant before heading on in.   These die-hard loyalists have heard it all before, and most don\u2019t disagree with man on the sidewalk.   They\u2019re convinced that McCain has seen the error of his ways, yet also admire him for sticking to his positions.   Polls show that there are plenty of South Carolinians who plan to vote for him tomorrow who aren\u2019t these die-hards.   And the best way for a Republican rival to get between McCain and these soft supporters would be on immigration.   The bill he wrote to grant citizenship rights to the vast majority of illegal aliens in the United States is opposed by some 80 percent of South Carolina voters.   But McCain has been playing the issue smartly. When asked about \u201camnesty,\u201d he cleverly couches his response in his military bona fides.   \u201cI\u2019m not going to call up a soldier in Iraq risking his life for America to tell him we\u2019re deporting his mother because she\u2019s here illegally,\u201d McCain says flatly. \u201cI\u2019m just not gonna do that.\u201d   It\u2019s possibly the only answer that works in a state where devotion to the military trumps any and all toxic issues, be they race, immigration or anything else.<em>churt@nypost.com</em>",
    "2008 - 4220": "Bobby Fischer, the Brooklyn high-school dropout who became a Cold War icon by beating the Russians at their game \u2013 then turned into a paranoid recluse who cheered the 9/11 attacks \u2013 has died.   Fischer, 64, died Thursday in Reykjavik, Iceland, the scene of his greatest triumph. He had been diagnosed with diseased kidneys but left hospital treatment last fall.   \u201cHe didn\u2019t believe in Western medicine,\u201d said a confidant, Einar Einarson.   His life was a series of contradictions.   The son of secular Jewish parents, he became a rabid anti-Semite and Holocaust denier.   The FBI suspected his leftist mother was a Moscow-trained spy \u2013 while Bobby was becoming a right-winger who drove himself to beat \u201cCommie cheaters\u201d at chess.   His fans were in awe when Fischer demanded and got six-figure prize funds, instead of the few thousands that previous champions earned. But he walked away from competition when he could have earned millions.   The mystery of Robert James Fischer began when he was born on March 9, 1943 in Chicago. His mother, Regina Wender, claimed his father was a German biophysicist \u2013 even though they had been separated for years.   Documents indicate Fischer\u2019s real father was Paul Nemenyi, a Hungarian Jewish physicist.   Bobby was 6 when his mother took him and his older sister, Joan, to their new home in Flatbush. In their Lincoln Place apartment, he and Joan learned the chess moves.   His natural talent for the game \u2013 and thrift-shop wardrobe \u2013 quickly earned him a nickname at chess clubs, \u201cThe Corduroy Killer.\u201d   Fischer dropped out of Erasmus Hall HS when he was 16. He had sat in classes with Barbra Streisand but always ridiculed the notion that they were friends. \u201cI remember some mousy-looking girl,\u201d he said.   When it became clear that the young genius was also a very troubled youth, the board of governors of the venerable Marshall Chess Club met to consider getting him professional help. The board was well into a discussion of how to find a psychiatrist for Bobby when someone asked: What if Bobby gets better \u2013 and decides to give up chess? The matter was dropped.   Fischer turned increasingly against his mother and convinced her to move out of their apartment. He was appalled when she picketed the White House to demand government support for the US team in the world chess olympiad of 1960.   Because of various disputes, Fischer disappeared from chess during 1964-65 and again in 1969. He spent weeks at a time living in hotel rooms, studying chess.   He wrote a book of his best games, then pulled back the manuscript from the publisher because he didn\u2019t want to reveal his secrets. He eventually changed his mind because, he said, \u201cThe world is coming to an end, anyway.\u201d   His return to chess in 1970 and rise to the championship was stunning. The vast majority of grandmaster games end in draws, but Fischer won 20 straight as he earned the right to challenge champion Boris Spassky.   The Spassky match was on the verge of collapse after Fischer issued a series of demands, about everything from the candlepower of lighting to the prize fund.   After a rocky start, Fischer beat Spassky and became the 11th official world champion on Sept. 1, 1972. He appeared on the covers of Time, Life, Newsweek and Sports Illustrated \u2013 and with Bob Hope on TV. But he withdrew from chess. He demanded changes in the championship rules and forfeited the title in 1975 when his demands were not met.   In 1992, he suddenly emerged at a remote Yugoslav resort to play Spassky in a $5 million rematch. He won easily, then disappeared again.   In 2004, Fischer said he wanted to renounce his US citizenship and was even held by Japanese authorities in July of the same year on charges of traveling with a revoked passport after he tried to board a flight in Tokyo to the Philippines.   He again gave ranting, anti-Semitic interviews on a Philippine radio station, and after 9/11 he told an interviewer he was overjoyed by the attacks and wanted the US \u201cwiped out.\u201d   In 2005, he was allowed to immigrate to Iceland after being granted citizenship there. It was Bobby Fischer\u2019s last victory.<em><a class=\"a10blb\" href=\"mailto:andy.soltis@nypost.com\">andy.soltis@nypost.com</a></em>",
    "2008 - 1510": "Four people were killed and three seriously injured \u2013 including one man forced to leap through a window \u2013 in fires yesterday in Brooklyn and The Bronx.   Three of the fatalities occurred in the Brooklyn blaze, on 18th Avenue near Bay Ridge Parkway. It began shortly before 7 a.m. in the middle room of a second-floor apartment where there was no fire escape.   With their exit blocked, four unconscious men \u2013 ranging in age from 30 to 50 and all believed to be Guatemalan immigrants \u2013 were dragged out of the building by firefighters.   \u201cIt looked like they were in the process of trying to get out when they were overcome,\u201d said Lt. Michael Doda of Ladder 168.   One victim was dead on arrival when the ambulance pulled up to Staten Island Hospital, and a second died in the emergency room, a hospital spokesman said. A third person died at the scene.   Another man was taken to Staten Island Hospital\u2019s burn center, where he was in critical condition.   One of the survivors landed on his feet in a bloody heap on the sidewalk \u2013 after bounding over a five-foot awning underneath the window \u2013 surrounded by shattered glass.   He was in stable condition at Lutheran Medical Center.   About an hour later, a blaze broke out on the second floor of a six-story Bronx building on Morris Avenue between East 182nd and East 183rd Streets.   Firefighters found two women unconscious in the kitchen. Blondell Alston, 76, died shortly after at Jacobi Hospital.   Her mother, Dorothy Brown, 97, was in stable condition. ",
    "2008 - 2545": "<a class=\"legacy-link\">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a> holds a double-digit lead over <a class=\"legacy-link\">Barack Obama</a> in New Jersey, a poll showed yesterday, as she headed to the Garden State to shore up support for the Super Tuesday vote.   Clinton snared 49 percent of likely Democratic voters in New Jersey, compared with 32 percent for Obama, according to the Quinnipiac University survey. John Edwards was in a distant third place, with just 10 percent.   Clinton held two late-day rallies in northern Jersey after appearing in Philadelphia, where she picked up the formal endorsement of Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, who runs a delegate-rich state and has a strong political operation that can work on her behalf.   In Hackensack, she hit bread-and-butter themes and cited the 9/11 attacks as something that bind New York and New Jersey.   \u201cAfter 9/11, we worked so closely together to make sure we took care of those who had had lost their loved ones,\u201d she said.   Later, Clinton, her voice raspy, spoke at a Hispanic-themed rally in North Bergen about pocket-book issues, immigration and the war in Iraq.   \u201cLatinos have a proud record of service in America,\u201d she said of Hispanic war vets.   The Quinnipiac poll showed the vote split somewhat along racial and gender lines. Obama led with black Democrats over Clinton, 62 percent to 27 percent, while she took a majority of white votes, 54 percent to 23 percent.   But this is one of the few surveys that showed Clinton leading with women, whose support she badly needs, and men.   She got 54 percent of the female vote to Obama\u2019s 28 percent, and 44 percent of the male vote. Obama got 36 percent support among men, the survey showed.   Meanwhile, on the stump yesterday, Obama ratcheted up his slams on Clinton as double-speaker on key issues like trade.   Politicians \u201cdon\u2019t always say what they mean, or mean what they say,\u201d Obama told a crowd of nearly 1,000 people at a rally in Rock Hill, SC, where voters will head to the polls this Saturday. \u201cThat is what this debate in this party is all about.\u201d   Clinton\u2019s husband, in Kingstree, SC, had a light moment when a 5-year-old, McKenna Chance, asked him at a campaign stop, \u201cWhat do you do when you get married?\u201d   Laughter erupted from the crowd of about 400 people. Bill Clinton joked about how the press would react, then said the best things about being married are spending your life with your best friend and having children.<em><a class=\"a10blb\" href=\"mailto:maggie.haberman@nypost.com\">maggie.haberman@nypost.com</a></em>",
    "2008 - 1213": " ALBANY \u2013 Outrage over <a class=\"legacy-link\">Gov. Spitzer</a>\u2018s plan to tax illegal drugs \u2013 dubbed the \u201ccrack tax\u201d by critics \u2013 grew yesterday, with some likening it to the governor\u2019s ill-fated plan to allow illegal immigrants to get drivers\u2019 licenses.   \u201cWhat\u2019s next, taxing prostitution?\u201d asked Assembly Minority Leader James Tedisco (R-Schenectady). \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see what kind of tax stamp they\u2019ll put on these girls in New York City and around the state.\u201d   On Tuesday, Spitzer proposed creating a tax stamp for illegal drugs that would cost $3.50 per gram for marijuana and $200 per gram for controlled substances.   Spitzer said the law would raise $13 million in the coming fiscal year and $17 million annually after that.   Some lawmakers said the plan sends a message that using drugs is OK as long as you pay your taxes, while on the other side, advocates for reduced penalties for illegal drug use complained there are already enough anti-drug penalties on the books.   \u201cTwenty-nine states across the nation have enacted laws that allow them to collect taxes on illegal drugs,\u201d said Spitzer spokesman Errol Cockfield. \u201cWe look forward to working with the Legislature on this and other proposals.\u201d ",
