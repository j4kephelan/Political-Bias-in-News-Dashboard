Duncan Hunter has formally submitted <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/12/06/california-congressman-duncan-hunter-to-quit-after-holidays/\">his letter of resignation</a> to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, saying he will vacate his congressional seat on Jan. 13.In the letter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Rep_Hunter/status/1214678578400518145\">posted to Twitter</a> on Tuesday, the Republican made no mention of <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/12/02/gop-rep-duncan-hunter-will-plead-guilty-to-swiping-250k-from-campaign/\">his December guilty plea</a> on charges of misusing at least $250,000 in campaign funds. Instead, he touted his military service, noting he enlisted in the Marines after 9/11, and his congressional work.\u201cAfter three tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, I was elected to the House and brought with me lessons I learned during my service in the Marine Corps and the values instilled by my father who held this seat before me,\u201d Hunter wrote.\u201cDuring my time in Congress, I had the privilege of helping thousands of individuals in my district \u2014 from making sure veterans received the benefits they earned, to helping Social Security and Medicare recipients cut through red tape, to assisting immigrants seeking legal citizenship, and countless others going up against the IRS, ATF or other government agencies,\u201d the Californian added as he noted his past accomplishments.The San Diego representative <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/08/21/gop-congressman-indicted-for-campaign-finance-violations/\">was charged with his wife, Margaret</a>, in August 2018 for spending campaign funds on family vacations to Italy and Hawaii, tuition for their children, theater tickets, groceries, restaurant bills, dental visits and even plane tickets for their pet bunny, Eggburt, to travel alongside them.Hunter initially slammed the indictment as politically motivated and brought on by \u201c<a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/08/23/gop-congressman-indicted-on-corruption-charges-blames-democrat-prosecutors/\">partisan Democrat prosecutors</a>,\u201d before his wife began to cooperate with investigators <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/06/13/duncan-hunters-wife-admits-she-bought-plane-ride-for-pet-bunny-with-campaign-funds/\">as part of a plea agreement</a> in June 2019 \u2014 which required her to testify against her husband.After pleading guilty, however, Hunter sought to spin the plea as a result of him making \u201cmistakes.\u201d\u201cI failed to monitor and account for my campaign spending. I made mistakes, and that\u2019s what [pleading guilty] was all about. So, that being said, I\u2019ll have more statements in the future about the future.\u201dCalifornia prosecutors slammed his comments, saying his crimes were \u201cnot about mismanagement of his campaign.\u201d\u201cCongressman Hunter himself misappropriated his own campaign funds for the use of himself and his family,\u201d using those funds \u201cas a piggy bank to float a lifestyle they couldn\u2019t maintain,\u201d Assistant US Attorney Phil Halpern, who was part of the prosecution team against the embattled politician, said in response.As part of his guilty plea, Hunter <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/12/04/gop-rep-duncan-hunters-seat-in-limbo-as-he-faces-5-years-behind-bars/\">faces up to five years behind bars</a>. Halpern said his office would seek a prison term of at least one year.",

    "2020 - 10415": "Like Marie-Antoinette, Carlos Ghosn\u2019s troubles escalated after a round of extravagant parties at the Palace of Versailles.When the former Nissan boss and international fugitive married his second wife Carole Nahas Marshi in 2016, he organized a sumptuous soiree for 120 guests at the sprawling 17th century chateau on the outskirts of Paris that was once home to the ill-fated last queen of France.Guests in black tie and sweeping gowns gathered for the lavish banquet that also doubled as Carole\u2019s 50th birthday celebration. They dined on Limoges china and drank vintage wine from Ghosn\u2019s own Ixsir vineyard in Lebanon. The four-foot wedding cake was a pyramid of choux pastry draped with fondant white flowers. Antique tables overflowed with pastel-colored macaroons, strawberries and grapes as guests mingled with costumed actors in powdered pompadour wigs.\u201cWe wanted it to feel as if we were inviting guests into our home \u2014 nothing too studied,\u201d Carole Ghosn told \u201cTown and Country,\u201d which featured photos of the sultry blonde in a striking green taffeta gown adorned with gold flowers by Paris designer Rabih Kayrouz.\u201cWhen you invite people to a party, they say maybe,\u201d said Carole, a Lebanese-born New Yorker. \u201cWhen you invite them to Versailles, they will come.\u201dCarole Ghosn spoke from experience, for the wedding was the second time the couple entertained at Versailles. The first was in 2014 when Ghosn personally invited 160 people to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the alliance between Nissan and Renault. But the March 9th dinner, which was catered by celebrity French chef Alain Ducasse and featured an elaborate fireworks display, coincided with Ghosn\u2019s 60th birthday, and not the March 27th birth of the joint venture in 1999.Most of the guests at the Louis XIV-inspired dinner were friends of the couple from around the world, according to French press reports. Only a handful of attendees were employees of the car giants, according to BFM TV in France, which obtained the exclusive guest list. Following the festivities, a 28-page photo album was emailed to all guests, and <a href=\"https://www.autonews.com/executives/ghosns-image-boosting-campaign-undermined-party-video\">a professionally shot video</a> of the soiree was produced.\u201cAs usual, I count on your total discretion on this event,\u201d warned the last line of Ghosn\u2019s invitation.Long known as \u201cLe Cost Cutter\u201d in France, the maverick executive had been credited with saving the car companies he oversaw from bankruptcy, largely by ruthlessly slashing jobs, cutting expenses and streamlining operations.At more than $700,000, the price-tag of the Versailles party would prove awkward as a corporate expense, and questions would also arise in France about who paid for the extravagant wedding reception/birthday party for his wife.In November 2018, Japanese authorities charged Ghosn with diverting company funds for his own benefit and underreporting his income in the tens of millions of dollars \u2014 his salary and stock options totaled $17 million in 2017.Two weeks ago,<a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/01/02/carlos-ghosn-parties-in-lebanon-after-instrument-case-escape-from-japan/\"> he escaped to Lebanon in an instrument case from Japan\u00a0</a>where he was on bail awaiting trial. Among the issues that seemed to bother his Nissan bosses most were the images of a tuxedoed Ghosn happily greeting guests at the Gallery of Great Battles, the Versailles Palace\u2019s grandest room where 15 centuries of French military victories are depicted on its walls.Carlos Ghosn, 65, wasn\u2019t always so rich or extravagant.His family has humble roots in the Brazilian Amazon where his grandfather, Bichara Ghosn, first settled as a 13-year-old, illiterate emigrant from Lebanon. The elder Ghosn went in search of El Dorado in the outback region, and took on a series of odd jobs in Porto Velho on the Madeira River, a tributary of the Amazon, where many Syrian and Lebanese immigrants settled in the 19th and 20th centuries. Although he soon made a good living in Brazil\u2019s aviation industry, Bichara Ghosn, a Maronite Christian, always longed to re-establish himself in his beloved native country.\u201cThe Maronites who emigrated have maintained their loyalty to Lebanon and to their family members who stayed in the old country,\u201d wrote Carlos Ghosn in his 2003 book \u201cShift: Inside Nissan\u2019s Historic Revival.\u201d \u201cThey send money. They pay to construct a house in their ancestral village and visit it from time to time.\u201dGhosn would follow his grandfather\u2019s example, investing heavily in a winery and other real estate ventures in Lebanon \u2014 a decision that would end up saving his life after he launched his dramatic escape from Tokyo to Beirut at the end of last year.Ghosn was born in Porto Velho on March 9, 1954, but after a childhood illness, his mother moved him to \u201cthe old country\u201d where he studied at an elite Jesuit school in Beirut. After high school, Ghosn left for Paris where he enrolled at a prestigious engineering school and met his first wife Rita Kordahi, a pharmacy student who, like Ghosn himself, was fond of bridge.\u00a0 She also has Lebanese roots.They married in 1984 when Ghosn was 30, and a year later took off for Rio de Janeiro, where the rising corporate star was put in charge of the Michelin tire company\u2019s South American operations. Ghosn was so successful at restructuring the firm and helping it become profitable that his corporate bosses in Paris put him charge of their operations in the US.The Ghosns moved with their young family \u2014 they have four children \u2014 to South Carolina where the corporate titan eventually was promoted to CEO of Michelin North America in 1990. Six years later, the family moved to Paris where he headed operations for Renault. In 1999 when Renault and Nissan formed their alliance, executives called on Ghosn as chief operating officer. By 2001, he was appointed CEO of Nissan, and uprooted his family yet again \u2014 this time to Tokyo.But following Ghosn around the world was tough on Rita who had abandoned her own career plans to raise her family and support Ghosn\u2019s successful trajectory, according to French press reports. By 2012, their marriage was over.\u201cAll narcissists are hypocrites,\u201d said Rita Ghosn in a social media post shortly after his arrest. \u201cThey pretend to have morals and values that they really don\u2019t possess. Behind closed doors, they lie, insult, criticize, disrespect and abuse. They can do and say whatever they want, but how dare you say anything back to them or criticize them.\u201dFriends of the couple said the bitterness largely stemmed from Ghosn\u2019s relationship with Carole Nahas Marshi, an Upper East Side-based mother of three who had been married to Lebanese-born banker Marwan Marshi.With Carole, a philanthropist and entrepreneur who once headed a high-end caftan company, Ghosn suddenly became a boldface name on the European social circuit. Often photographed holding hands, the happy couple regularly attended glittering charity events, the Cannes Film Festival and the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio. They flew on a lavish corporate jet to\u00a0 Ghosn\u2019s sprawling homes in Rio de Janeiro, Paris, Amsterdam, Tokyo and Beirut \u2014 all multi-million dollar properties that Ghosn convinced Nissan to buy for him. His French lawyers recently defended the purchases, saying it was much cheaper for the company to put him up at a series of private residences when he traveled on business rather than paying for high-end hotel rooms for Ghosn and his security team.Since New Year\u2019s Eve, the couple, who had not been allowed to see each other for months while Ghosn was imprisoned in Japan, have been happily esconced at their $15-million salmon-hued mansion in Beirut. The $6 million renovations to the property, financed by Nissan, include expensive antiques and portraits of the former CEO.\u201cI have not fled justice \u2014 I have escaped injustice and political persecution,\u201d an audacious Ghosn insisted <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/01/08/carlos-ghosn-slams-smear-campaign-by-japanese-authorities-and-nissan/\">at a press conference that stretched for more than two hours in Beirut</a> last week in which he alternated answering reporters\u2019 questions in Arabic, French, Portuguese and English. Ghosn holds Brazilian, French and Lebanese citizenship, and is beloved in Lebanon where the president Michel Aoun met with him hours after his arrival last month. Some Lebanese politicians had always hoped that the man who saved Nissan would do the same for the country one day and encouraged Ghosn to run for political office. In 2017, the country issued a postage stamp with his face on it. Although Lebanese authorities banned him from traveling outside the country last week, they said they will not comply with an Interpol \u201cred notice\u201d to extradite Ghosn to Japan.Last week, Japan requested that Interpol arrest Carole Ghosn, who is wanted in Japan on charges that she allegedly gave false testimony about her husband during a court appearance in Japan in April. Like her husband, Carole Ghosn is a Lebanese citizen.In addition to vigorously denying allegations of financial crimes, Ghosn accused Japanese law enforcement and former corporate colleagues of colluding against him to plot his downfall. After his arrest in 2018, Ghosn spent 14 months in prison and house arrest. He was often interrogated without the presence of an attorney and cut off from his family, he said.In addition to his troubles in Japan, Ghosn also addressed his Versailles parties last week, which have been the subject of ongoing probes in France. Auditors for Nissan are looking into Renault-Nissan BV, a Netherlands corporate entity which Japanese authorities said Ghosn used to finance his lavish lifestyle, including the purchase of a yacht and various homes around the world.Ghosn said he did not pay to rent Versailles for his wife\u2019s party in 2016 because the palace\u2019s renovations had been bankrolled by Renault. Somehow, the $55,000 price tag for the party was deducted from \u201cthe credit Renault earns from being a sponsor of Versailles,\u201d he said. Ghosn has said he will pay back the cost of the swanky affair.\u201cCatherine Pegard, who is the head of Versailles, told me, \u2018Mr. Ghosn you are a big benefactor, you know from time to time for our big friends we can make rooms available. If you have a private party, we can make rooms available,\u2019\u201d said Ghosn at the press conference. \u201cI say thank you very much.\u201d",
    "2020 - 3698": "The seventh Democratic debate \u2014 and the last one before the Iowa caucuses \u2014 will air Tuesday night, pitting six of the 12 remaining White House hopefuls against each other in the smallest matchup of the 2020 election cycle.Here\u2019s what you need to know ahead of the nationally televised contest.The debate will kick off at 9 p.m. EST and is slated to run for two hours. It\u2019s being held at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, a traditional battleground state looked to as an election bellwether.The debate will air live on CNN, and can also be streamed through the network\u2019s Web site or its apps.The following six candidates will square off Tuesday night: former Vice President Joe Biden; Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren; Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders; South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar; and billionaire hedge-funder Tom Steyer.Businessman and outsider candidate Andrew Yang will have to watch the debate from afar, as he failed to make the Democratic National Committee\u2019s polling thresholds to appear Tuesday night. Meanwhile, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/01/13/cory-booker-suspends-2020-presidential-run/\">suspended his own foundering campaign</a> on Monday, having previously failed to make the cut for December\u2019s debate. And billionaire former New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg, who is self-funding his campaign, failed to make the mark despite polling at 5 percent in most surveys.From left to right, the candidates will stand in the following order: Steyer, Warren, Biden, Sanders, Buttigieg and Klobuchar.The debate will be moderated by a trio of journalists from CNN and The Des Moines Register. They are CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer, CNN political correspondent Abby Phillip and The Register\u2019s chief political correspondent, Brianne Pfannenstiel.In addition to evergreen topics including health-care, immigration and gun control, the debate will likely feature a pronounced emphasis on foreign policy in light of recent <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/01/07/iraq-airbase-with-us-troops-targeted-in-rocket-attack-reports/\">tensions between the US and Iran</a>. With House Speaker Nancy Pelosi set to <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/01/10/nancy-pelosi-will-send-articles-of-impeachment-to-senate-next-week/\">deliver articles of impeachment</a> against President Trump to the Senate, the looming specter of a trial is also likely to be raised <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">\u2014 particularly because senators now comprise half the field.</span>Sparks may also fly between Sanders and Warren, after it emerged that in a Dec. 2018 conversation between the two, Sanders purportedly <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/01/13/elizabeth-warren-bernie-sanders-told-me-a-woman-would-not-be-elected-president/\">told Warren that a woman couldn\u2019t win</a> the presidency. After CNN reported the alleged comment on Monday, Warren said in a statement that it was true, while Sanders told the network that it was \u201cludicrous.\u201dA <a href=\"https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_IA_011320/\">Monmouth University poll</a> released on Monday found Biden holding a 24-percent share among likely Democratic caucus voters in the Hawkeye State. Sanders, Buttigieg and Warren are currently in a logjam at the middle of the pack, holding 18-, 17- and 15-percent, respectively. Klobuchar came in at 8-percent, while Steyer attracted half that.Following Tuesday\u2019s contest, the candidates will next debate on Feb. 7 at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire. That event kicks off a busy month for the candidates, with two additional debates scheduled for Feb. 19 in Las Vegas, Nevada, and Feb. 25 in Charleston, South Carolina."
