    "2011 - 1901": "Hong Kong authorities said Monday they have arrested eight people in connection with the bizarre case of a Chinese man who flew to Canada last year disguised as an elderly Caucasian male.A ground staff employee at Hong Kong\u2019s international airport, along with two former airport employees, were among the suspects arrested at the weekend, an immigration department spokeswoman confirmed to AFP.The Standard newspaper in Hong Kong reported the eight people arrested after a two month investigation are aged between 26 and 62. It revealed the man at the center of the case, which made global headlines, made it through immigration with a genuine passport, then obtained a fake passport and boarding pass in the departure hall before boarding.Five men and three women have been accused of helping \u201cillegal migrants board Canada-bound flights in at least five cases\u201d including the man who donned a silicone mask to fool immigration officials, she told AFP.The man, who had \u201cyoung-looking hands\u201d, shocked passengers when he was seen emerging from the airplane\u2019s washroom as a young Asian male during the flight in October, according to a Canada Border Services Agency (CSBA) report.\u201cWe have arrested eight suspects,\u201d the spokeswoman said Monday.\u201cThey are suspected of being involved in boarding pass swapping, passport selling and conspiracy to defraud the airline operator,\u201d she added.The group charged about 300,000 yuan (US$45,000) for helping migrants enter Canada illegally between April and October last year.The suspects are believed to have supplied false papers to the migrants once they reached Hong Kong, a city of seven million that maintains a semi-autonomous status within China.The Chinese man \u2014 who has not been identified and is believed to be in his twenties \u2014 sought asylum after arriving in Vancouver.The Vancouver Sun reported that he was still being detained by immigration in Canada.",
    "2011 - 5030": "MIAMI \u2014 Haitian-American leaders and others are using Wednesday\u2019s anniversary of Haiti\u2019s massive earthquake to implore the Obama administration to welcome tens of thousands of Haitians who were promised visas but remain in the crippled Caribbean country on waiting lists.Immigration authorities had approved requests from 55,000 Haitians to join relatives in the United States before the earthquake. But because the U.S. caps the number of visas it grants per country annually, it can take a decade for an approved request to produce a visa.Supporters want the State Department to waive the visa limit and thereby bolster the ranks of expatriate Haitians.The argument is based on more than compassion: Haitians abroad already send more than $1 billion back home each year, about a sixth of the gross domestic product for the hemisphere\u2019s most impoverished nation.\u201cThey\u2019ll be able to send money to help their families back in Haiti,\u201d said North Miami Mayor Andre Pierre, whose city of 57,000 is roughly a third Haitian and would anticipate absorbing thousands of the visa-holders if they were bumped to the front of the immigration line. \u201cThen (their families) won\u2019t have to be constantly asking the United States government and other international communities for help, constantly trying to get aid from them when they can help themselves.\u201dPierre, himself a Haitian immigrant, put forth a resolution last year that his colleagues in the U.S. Conference of Mayors approved urging the administration to issue the visas it has promised.Federal officials are reviewing the issue, said Chris Bentley, a spokesman for the Citizenship and Immigration Services agency.Allowing the 55,000 Haitians to jump the visa line could suddenly burden the infrastructure and environment for a population that has grown rapidly in the last 10 years because of immigration, both legal and illegal, said David North, a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington.And there\u2019s no guarantee that they wouldn\u2019t create a void when they left, he said.\u201cThese 55,000 are probably above average in income, education and luck. They\u2019re not a cross-section of Haitian society \u2014 they\u2019re probably already considerably better off than the average Haitian,\u201d North said.\u201cIf those people come from Haiti, the money that had previously come to them from the United States will just stop coming, and that\u2019s hard on Haiti.\u201dEven so, proponents of the speeded-up visa plan call remittances by expatriate Haitians an economic lifeline to a country that \u2014 between the rubble, a cholera outbreak and political unrest \u2014 still seems in many respects as if the quake happened last week, not last year.The magnitude 7.0 earthquake on Jan. 12, 2010, killed more than 230,000. Roughly a million remain homeless amid the debris and stuttering reconstruction efforts in Port-au-Prince.Survivors now in the U.S., many of whom were airlifted for medical care, say they\u2019ll mark the anniversary feeling blessed to be alive, but also anxious about what the next year will bring.Many survive only on the financial support of relatives or charities because in their scramble to get out of Haiti they were not granted papers by the U.S. allowing them to work. Even those who were granted permission to work have had trouble finding jobs as they navigate medical care for injured children and bureaucracy in finding someplace to live.\u201cI\u2019m not allergic to work \u2014 I\u2019ll cut grass, I\u2019ll do anything,\u201d said Prevener Julian, a 42-year-old farmer and market vendor who accompanied his 8-year-old son Belix, who needed treatment for head trauma. Julian is living in a Miami homeless shelter.Many of the Haitians brought to the U.S. in the first weeks of the international aid effort thought they would be going back after a while. Now, they are not so sure.The shock and disruption of the earthquake has been followed by the shock of the reality that going back is nowhere near a viable option.\u201cNow they have to readjust to living here,\u201d said Elsie St. Louis-Accilien, executive director of Haitian-Americans United for Progress, a community-based organization in Queens. \u201cThese are people who did not plan on doing this.\u201dValerie Placide, who fled with her 9-year-old son in the days after the quake, has watched from Spring Valley, N.Y., just north of New York City and some 1,500 miles from Haiti, as recovery efforts floundered, cholera killed more than 3,600 and political unrest turned to riots.\u201cYou\u2019ve spent a year hoping that everything would be better,\u201d Placide said. Instead, she said, \u201cI\u2019m not hopeful at all.\u201dThousands of children were evacuated to the U.S. following the quake. Sitting with his mother last week in the same Miami shelter where Julian lives, 10-year-old Peterson Exais contemplated someday returning to Port-au-Prince, where he spent four days buried beneath the rubble of his house. Thin, pale scars cut through his hair and circle his left eye.\u201cIt\u2019s better here,\u201d he says in the English he\u2019s learned this past year in hospitals and school. \u201cHaiti is broken.\u201d",
    "2011 - 5512": "TUCSON, Ariz. \u2014 The federal judge killed in the Arizona shooting rampage was known for an immigration ruling that got him death threats, but on Friday he was remembered as a man devoted to his family, his basset hounds and his Irish-Catholic heritage. U.S. District Judge John Roll had stopped by a supermarket meet-and-greet for Rep. Gabrielle Giffords on Saturday when he was killed, along with five others. Giffords, recovering from a gunshot wound to the head, was still in critical condition, but progressing. Roll\u2019s funeral Friday came amid tight security, as police officers and SWAT team members patrolled the neighborhood around St. Elizabeth Ann Seton church. About a dozen coach buses brought judges who knew Roll over the years. The speakers focused less on Judge Roll and more on John Roll, tender and at times goofy, and largely hidden from those he served. \u201cIt made it very personal,\u201d said Carol Bahill, 61, whose husband knew Roll from his undergraduate and law school days at the University of Arizona. \u201cYou do feel like you knew something about him personally.\u201d The news media were barred from the event at the request of Roll\u2019s family and for security reasons. The Associated Press interviewed mourners, such as Bahill, as they left the service and got an account of the funeral. Roll\u2019s older brother, Ed, told mourners that his family moved to Arizona from Pittsburgh when Roll was a child because their mother\u2019s health was failing and doctors thought the weather might help. When Roll\u2019s mother eventually died, of a heart condition, the future judge was just 15. Her death deeply affected him and he changed his middle name from Paul to his mother\u2019s maiden name of McCarthy \u201cto keep that part of the family alive,\u201d Bahill said. His brother said he stepped in as Roll\u2019s de facto parent, driving him to school and chaperoning him on some dances. Bahill said she appreciated gaining more insight into the private life and personality of Roll. His funeral comes a day after the youngest victim, Christina Taylor Green, was eulogized, also at the same church. Many members of Roll\u2019s family, including his sons and five grandchildren, participated in the funeral Mass and speakers also included a childhood friend, his chief clerk and a colleague on the federal bench. The service ended with a rendition of \u201cWhen Irish Eyes Are Smiling.\u201d Dignitaries attending included Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer as well as Sens. John McCain and Jon Kyl. Former Vice President Dan Quayle brought a handwritten message from former President George H.W. Bush, who appointed Roll to the bench in 1991, said Adam Goldberg, a spokesman for the fire department and the event. Before Jan. 8, Roll, 63, was known for the death threats he received after his ruling in a border-crossing case two years ago. He needed 24-hour protection after he said 16 illegal immigrants could file a civil rights claim against an Arizona border rancher. Roll had stopped by Giffords\u2019 event after attending Mass to see the Democratic lawmaker and thank her for her fight for more federal judges in southwest Arizona to help with a dramatic increase in felony federal cases linked to illegal immigration. Giffords\u2019 husband, Mark Kelly, was among the mourners Friday. In a brief news conference, her doctors said she was progressing in her recovery. Jared Loughner, 22, has been charged with murder and attempted murder for Roll\u2019s death and the assassination attempt against Giffords. Documents released Friday showed that he bought bullets at a Walmart and posted \u201cGoodbye friends\u201d on the Internet. Roll\u2019s death leaves a huge hole in the federal judiciary in Arizona, not just because of his reputation as a fair-minded and hardworking jurist, said Paul Carter, assistant attorney general for the state of Arizona. He was a vocal advocate of getting more help for the state\u2019s overtaxed federal bench, Carter said. \u201cOur court down here is already quite over-stressed with a number of issues relating to the border especially and Judge Roll was a champion of trying to get more resources down to southern Arizona,\u201d he said. The speakers, however, did not dwell on Roll\u2019s killing. They focused on lighthearted moments from his life. The judge\u2019s lifelong friend, Rev. John Lyons, recounted how as boys it was not uncommon for Roll to find himself sitting on a different kind of bench \u2014 the one outside the principal\u2019s office. Other speakers joked that Roll was \u201cspatially challenged\u201d and got lost driving to McDonald\u2019s. He once backed his car into his own garage and on another occasion ran into someone\u2019s classic Jaguar. \u201cThat\u2019s always a good thing to hear, that people do things like that, like the rest of us do,\u201d Bahill said. \u201cIt made him very human.\u201d Roll\u2019s brother, Ed, also told of the family\u2019s annual camping trip to Lake Roosevelt in Arizona for Father\u2019s Day, which drew strenuous objections from the judge\u2019s wife because of temperatures that reached into the triple digits. \u201cShe called it the vacation from hell,\u201d said Bob McLaughlin, 64, who recounted the story told at the funeral. Some of Roll\u2019s neighbors said they never suspected his line of work, particularly because Roll never seemed pretentious and enjoyed everyday activities, such as walking his two basset hounds every morning and spending time with his wife and grandchildren. \u201cHe was just a neighbor,\u201d said George Kriss, 70, adding that the last time he saw Roll a few weeks ago, \u201che had blue jeans on and just a very normal shirt and was hanging onto a couple of leashes.\u201d ",
