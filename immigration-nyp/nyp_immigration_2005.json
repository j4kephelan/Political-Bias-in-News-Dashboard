    "2005 - 1069": "A Columbia University football player is off the hook for a brutish sexual attack on a female student \u2013 pleading guilty in return for a no-jail sentence.   But now he\u2019s facing deportation.   Aaron Percival, 20, had been charged with sneaking into the student\u2019s dorm room in September 2003, waking her by licking her toes and then mauling her with his hand so roughly that her cervix was bruised.   He had faced a minimum prison sentence of 3 \u00bd years if he had been convicted at trial, scheduled to begin yesterday.   Instead, a Manhattan Supreme Court judge yesterday promised a sentence of 10 months probation in return for Percival\u2019s last-minute guilty plea to the reduced charge of attempted sexual abuse.   Percival \u2013 a London-born British citizen who moved here at age 3, and whose family lives in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. \u2013 must also register with the state as a sex offender.   But as an admitted felon without U.S. citizenship, Percival faces certain deportation, and his green card has already been seized by immigration officials, said his lawyer, Brian Waller. ",
    "2005 - 2133": "The Army specialist let her commander-in-chief lead.   Army Spc. Jazmin Azcona, a Queens native, took to the floor with President Bush at the Commander-in-Chief Ball during last night\u2019s inaugural festivities.   \u201cIt was exciting. I was really nervous,\u201d the 23-year-old GI, whose family lives in Corona, told The Post. \u201cIt was the first time I got to meet the president.\u201d   Azcona, a clerk with the 12th Aviation Battalion out of Fort Belvoir in Virginia, said Bush was \u201creally nice.\u201d   As the president danced with Azcona, First Lady Laura Bush was partnered with Marine Lance Cpl. Richard Hansen.   Azcona said the president was quiet on the dance floor, but gracious to her and Hansen.   \u201cHe thanked us when we were done and he thanked us for our service to the country,\u201d she said.   Azcona is a graduate of Newtown HS.   Her father, Pedro Azcona, who immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic 25 years ago, was watching the inaugural balls on TV, but didn\u2019t notice his daughter take to the dance floor with the president.   When told by The Post of his daughter\u2019s turn in the spotlight, Pedro Azcona said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know. She told me she was going to some sort of celebration, but I didn\u2019t know what it was.\u201d   Spc. Azcona played it coy when asked how the big boss \u2013 a self-admitted and notoriously poor hoofer \u2013 performed, but her dad, who saw Bush out on the floor with other women, approved.   \u201cHe danced good. I saw,\u201d he said.   Jazmin, who has a brother and a sister, joined the Army four years ago and was stationed in Kuwait for six months last years.   Her unit was not in the vanguard, she said, but near enough to the action to have come under missile attack.   Pedro Azcona said his daughter is the athletic type who played a lot of sports in school.   More importantly, he said, \u201cShe\u2019s the type of person who was trying to helpful to others.\u201d   The proud dad talks to Jazmin every week, and saw her a few weeks ago when she came up from Virginia for a visit.   He grew prouder still when shown a picture of his daughter waltzing with the president.   \u201cThere\u2019s a girl who did something right,\u201d he said.",
    "2005 - 1445": " FBI agents were questioning one of the Chinese nationals sought in a purported plot to set off a radioactive bomb in Boston, Fox News Channel reported yesterday.   Mei Xia Dong, believed to be 21 years old, was one of 14 people the FBI had sought in the plot. It was unclear where Dong was arrested.   The FBI on Wednesday released names and photographs of four people it sought for questioning, and on Thursday released the names of 10 more people it was seeking.   Thirteen of those being sought were Chinese. Some allegedly crossed the border from Mexico.   The FBI did not release the nationality of the 14th person, whose name is Jos\u00e9 Ernesto Beltran Quinones.   Dong\u2019s name was on the 10-person list. His role in the alleged plot was unclear, and the FBI has said it wasn\u2019t even certain the people it seeks pose any threat.   Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney said he was growing less concerned about the threat, and said law-enforcment authorities in the state were taking the matter less seriously.   None of the 14 people sought by the FBI faced criminal charges \u201cbecause there\u2019s no evidence at this point in time that they\u2019ve committed any crimes,\u201d Boston\u2019s top federal prosecutor said Thursday.

    "2005 - 1458": "It was bad enough to hear the comedian known as \u201cAli G\u201d butcher the National Anthem, according to some patriotic cowboys, but it was even worse to be paid for it.   Before infamous comedian Sacha Baron Cohen took to the stage at a rodeo in Salem, Va., to sing offensive versions of the National Anthem, he first had to scam the rodeo\u2019s producers by paying them off.   \u201cHe\u2019s just a real scumbag con artist,\u201d said rodeo producer Lenore Rowe, who agreed to let Baron Cohen sing thinking he was just an innocent immigrant traveling across the United States for a documentary. \u201cWhat a mistake.\u201d   As soon as Baron Cohen \u2013 who was posing as alter-ego Borat Sagdiyev of Kazakhstan, a character on his HBO show \u2013 showed up at the Salem Civic Center on Jan. 9, \u201chis people\u201d pressed rodeo workers to sign waivers \u201cjust in case they ended up in the documentary,\u201d and gave them between $50 and $150 each.   \u201cThey tried to give it back,\u201d Rowe said. \u201cBut they insisted. Now we know why.\u201d   The exchange of money could create a binding contract, relieving Baron Cohen and his gang of liability, even though they misrepresented themselves, an entertainment lawyer told The Post.   His version of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d ended with \u201cyour home in the grave.\u201d   The angry crowd turned on the comedian, booing and screaming for him to get off the stage \u2013 while cameras rolled and focused on shocked audience members.   Cohen was escorted out, flanked by his own armed guards.",

    "2005 - 4816": "Chilling audiotapes that captured two doomed firefighters\u2019 final moments in a Bronx inferno Sunday reveal desperate pleas for help as flames suddenly engulfed them.   \u201cWe can\u2019t get out!\u201d screamed one panicked firefighter trapped alongside the pair on the fourth floor of the building at 236 E. 178th St. in the Morris Heights section, according to recordings of the Fire Department\u2019s radio communications.   \u201cMayday! Mayday! Mayday! Fire in the apartment!\u201d one of the tragic two firefighters is heard yelling.   A stricken firefighter who is watching in horror from outside the rear of the building screams to comrades:   \u201cThey\u2019re at the windows! They\u2019re at the windows!   \u201cThere\u2019s heavy smoke! Heavy smoke and fire!\u201d he yells. Then, as six trapped firefighters begin to jump from a window \u2013 two to their deaths \u2013 he screams, \u201cFireman down! Fireman down!\u201d   The tapes portray a scene that quickly turned from routine firefighting to a deadly nightmare, after the firemen on the fourth floor were told to give their hose to colleagues on the third floor, where the main blaze was burning. The switch was made because the firefighters on the lower floor had lost pressure in their hose.   At one point, a firefighter on the fourth floor radios that he is having trouble breathing because of the smoke, so a colleague on the roof lowers an oxygen mask to him.   During the tapes \u2013 which last two to three minutes \u2013 a fire chief radios up to the smoke-eaters on the fourth floor, asking if there are flames where they are.   They respond no.   Then, \u201csuddenly, a fireball appears and turns on them,\u201d a source said.   \u201cIt swept around dividing walls [erected in the apartment] after coming through the floor,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t see it until too late. It came roaring at them.   \u201cListening to them, it\u2019s so sudden [that] you can sense how quickly and severely the room changed on them,\u201d the source said. \u201cFirst, they\u2019re talking in general terms. Then it becomes this urgent, \u2018Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!\u2019 It just whipped around and trapped them.   \u201cIt\u2019s tough to listen to \u2013 they\u2019re just trying to save themselves.   \u201cWhen they start giving the Mayday, the fire\u2019s already moving toward them.\u201d   The source said that as the firemen scream for help, \u201cThey\u2019re scrambling to the window. [But] there are child-protection gates on one window that they have to get out of the way. There\u2019s [also] an air conditioner in the window.\u201d   Sources said the firefighters were thrown into the deadly confusion because of a maze of partitions that had been erected in the apartment, which blocked their view of another window leading to the fire escape.   The apartment had been converted into a cheap flophouse for immigrants, with the living room and dining room turned into two small bedrooms. That gave the space a total of four bedrooms, sources said.   Authorities said one couple and three men lived there. But the tenant who leased the space for the building\u2019s out-of-town owner told The Post that the apartment housed six adults and three little girls. She said she charged each person between $50 and $100 a week in rent.   The woman denied knowing who erected the partitions.   The firefighters who died jumping from the inferno were Lt. Curtis Meyran, 46, a twice-decorated 15-year veteran, and firefighter John Bellew, 37, also of Ladder 27.   Among the four who survived the jump was Brendan Cawley, who joined the FDNY in September, inspired by his brother, Michael, a Bravest who died on 9/11.   Cawley, 31, was still in critical condition yesterday at St. Barnabas Hospital in The Bronx.   It was Meyran who ordered Cawley to jump, saving the young probie\u2019s life, fire officials said.   \u201cYou are told you have to jump out the window and you jump out the window,\u201d said Chief Joseph Callan, the FDNY\u2019s Bronx borough commander.   \u201cCawley lost his brother on 9/11, and he goes to one of his first fires, and he has to go out the window,\u201d the chief said. \u201cWhat can be going through his mind? They had to know you probably won\u2019t survive.\u201d   The three other injured firefighters are Jeffrey Cool, 37, Eugene Stolowski, 33, and Joseph DiBernardo, 34. They were badly hurt, but expected to recover.   Several hours after the Bronx blaze, Brooklyn firefighter Richard Sclafani, 37, of Ladder Co. 103 died after becoming trapped while battling a blaze in the basement of an East New York home.   Marshals said the Bronx fire was caused by an overheated extension cord that ignited a mattress.   \u2014-  Excerpts of FDNY transcripts  FIREMEN IN THE APARTMENT:  \u201cWe can\u2019t get out!\u201d  \u201cMayday!

    "2005 - 4106": "Today\u2019s lesson takes a look at one of New York\u2019s most infamous characters who was also one of the most corrupt politicians in history, William \u201cboss\u201d Tweed.  You\u2019ve probably heard of the Tweed Courthouse. As headquarters of the Department of Education, it\u2019s where many of the decisions concerning your life at public school in New York City are made. This courthouse is named after a brilliant, but rotten-to-the-core New Yorker \u2013 William Marcy \u201cBoss\u201d Tweed.   The courthouse was the headquarters of The Society of St. Tammany, which started out as a social club in 1789. For new immigrants flooding into the Lower East Side, Tammany was their only voice in a hostile city. Most found themselves in a foreign land, with no homes or jobs. Most could not speak English, and for many, voting in a democratic society was a privilege they had never enjoyed before. They repaid Tammany with those votes.  By 1851, more than half of the city\u2019s voters were immigrants, loyal to Tammany Hall.   In 1863, Tammany would gain even more power after the Civil War Draft Riots. Tammany Hall was seen as the only hope to control the violence. That same year, a genial chairmaker and ex-fireman who had risen through the ranks at Tammany was sworn in as its head, or Grand Sachem. His name was WilliamMarcy Tweed.   Tweed used his followers\u2019 blind loyalty to hold the largest urban power base of any American politician. He provided jobs and built poorhouses, hospitals and orphanages. He poured public funds into Catholic schools and charities. The Tweed machine controlled the construction of all new parks, streets, bridges, hospitals and schools. Construction companies paid Tammany huge kickbacks for building contracts.   By 1870, Tweed controlled 12,000 city jobs and every cent the city spent for public service. He controlled every aspect of the city\u2019s government. He was, at once, the school commissioner, assistant street commissioner, president of the board of supervisors, chairman of the New York Democratic Committee, New York\u2019s state senator and Grand Sachem at Tammany Hall.   Upper-class New Yorker\u2019s seemed horrified by Tweed\u2019s actions, but were secretly pleased with the rise in Manhattan\u2019s real estate.   The Tammany Hall headquarters itself was valued at $350,000, but after 12 years of construction, the price climbed to $13 million. Critics complained that it took twice as long to build as the Erie Canal and cost more than Alaska.   The Tweed machine began to crumble when the political cartoons of Thomas Nast appeared in Harper\u2019s Weekly. They depicted Tweed as a fat, bald, greedy giant, devouring the city.   The end came when The New York Times published excerpts from secret courthouse records. Some of the outrageous purchases were: 11 thermometers for $7,500, brooms for $41,000, windows for $8,000, each and three chairs and four tables at $179,792. It was reported that Tweed and his gang had stolen $200 million from New York.   In 1871, Tweed was indicted on three counts of fraud and grand larceny and 220 misdemeanors. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison. The charges were overturned, but a civil suit stripped his assets and he was sent to debtor\u2019s prison on what today is called Roosevelt Island.   Nast\u2019s cartoons would prove to be Tweed\u2019s final undoing when, after slipping past his guards, he fled to Spain and was recaptured when the Spanish police recognized him from one of the cartoons.   He was returned to a jail he built himself, where he died penniless on April 12, 1878. But to many of the city\u2019s poor, even in death, Tweed maintained his reputation as their hero.

    "2005 - 2384": "A crooked father-and-son plumbing team was sent up the river last night for ripping off millions from the MTA.   \u201cThese are very serious crimes,\u201d prosecutor Patrick Dugan said before millionaire plumbers Alex Figliolia Sr. and Jr. were sentenced for their bribery and overcharging racket.   \u201cThe defendants stole money from the fare payers of this city.\u201d   The elder Figliolia, his wife Janet, and Alex Jr. pleaded guilty to bilking the MTA out of millions last September.   Prosecutors said that much of their ill-gotten gains went into their ill-decorated mansion in Holmdel, N.J., which features an indoor pool with waterfall, outdoor swan pond and indoor and outdoor pizza ovens.   Dugan said the family\u2019s scams were fairly simple \u2013 they paid their mostly immigrant labor force about $8 an hour to do plumbing work for them at MTA locations, and billed the transit agency $65 to $135 an hour for their work, the prevailing union wage for plumbers.   They also overcharged on materials and labor, and bribed MTA officials to look the other way.   Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Roger Hayes sentenced the family members in accordance with the terms of their plea deal.   Figliolia Sr., 61, was sentenced to 13/4 to 53/4 years in prison, while Jr., 31, was sentenced to 23/4 to 8\u00bd years behind bars.   Janet, 54, was sentenced to five years probation.   The family also forked over $6 million in restitution, which they raised by selling their business property at 420 Carroll St. in Brooklyn, and turned over $750,000 worth of Janet\u2019s jewelry.   Hayes called the punishment \u201cfair\u201d and a \u201csensible resolution.\u201d   Figliolia Sr.\u2019s lawyer, Ron Fischetti, told the judge it was \u201ca difficult day\u201d for his client.   \u201cHis money is gone. His son is going to jail,\u201d he said, referring to the three-year scam as \u201ca small portion . . . of what has otherwise been a very law-abiding life.\u201d   Janet\u2019s lawyer, David Smith, said it was also a hard day for his client. \u201cShe\u2019s walking out alone,\u201d he said.   Warren Feldman, the lawyer for Figliolia Jr., said his client, a married Staten Islander, \u201cknows he made a mistake\u201d and is \u201clooking forward to putting this behind him.\u201d   Three corrupt MTA officials \u2013 former director of facility operations Howard Weissman, former facilities manager Ronald Allan and ex-buildings manager Gary Weissbard \u2013 have pleaded guilty to taking bribes from the family."
