    "2021 - 3207": "Joe Biden wants to send millions of Americans their third stimulus check \u2014 and give others their first.The president-elect\u2019s <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/01/14/joe-biden-announces-1-9-trillion-covid-19-economic-package/\">$1.9 trillion economic relief plan</a> calls for yet another round of direct payments to help people pay bills and support their families during the coronavirus pandemic.The proposal would also expand eligibility for the $1,400 checks to some people left out of the first two rounds of relief.One key group is adults who can be claimed as dependents on other people\u2019s income tax returns, such as college students or elderly people being cared for by their adult children.Both previous stimulus bills providing direct payments only allowed taxpayers to collect additional money for dependent children younger than 17. Last March\u2019s CARES Act gave households $500 for each qualifying kid on top of $1,200 per adult, while December\u2019s $900 billion relief package <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/01/12/delayed-stimulus-checks-should-arrive-by-february/\">offered $600 for children and adults alike</a>.Biden\u2019s new plan could also provide stimulus checks to a broader swath of immigrant families.\u00a0<a href=\"https://buildbackbetter.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/COVID_Relief-Package-Fact-Sheet.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The plan</a>\u00a0calls for expanding eligibility\u00a0to \u201call mixed status households,\u201d\u00a0a term referring to families in which one person is a US citizen or green card holder while others lack legal immigration status. Roughly 16 million people in the US live in mixed status families, including an estimated 6.1 million children who are American citizens,\u00a0<a href=\"https://immigrationforum.org/article/mixed-status-families-and-covid-19-economic-relief/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to the National Immigration Forum</a>.Last month\u2019s stimulus bill took a step in this direction by providing $600 payments to American citizens married to undocumented immigrants. But the money wasn\u2019t available to undocumented parents of US-citizen children with Social Security numbers,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/second-eip-faqs\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to the Internal Revenue Service</a>.Biden\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t specifically say whether those families would be eligible for the $1,400 checks.\u00a0While its language suggests that currently ineligible immigrant households would receive the funds, a Biden transition official told The Post that anyone who receives a so-called economic impact payment must have a Social Security number.If Congress approves Biden\u2019s plan, Americans who\u2019ve been eligible for all three stimulus checks would end up getting $3,200 directly from the feds during the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to choose between paying rent and putting food on the table,\u201d Biden said in a Thursday speech announcing the package.But it\u2019s likely to face pushback from Republican lawmakers who balked at the high price tags of previous stimulus proposals. Biden may have to compromise on some provisions with conservative senators concerned about the national debt, as The Post reported Thursday.",

Many nations have also expressed concerns about how the caravan could become a breeding ground for COVID-19 and who would care for stricken migrants without documentation.It\u2019s the first migrant caravan of 2021 and the first that will likely crash along the US border during President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. Though Biden has promised more lenient immigrants rules, his officials have warned that many of Trump\u2019s immigration policies will likely remain for the foreseeable future.\u201cWe will be able to take some steps to change policies right away. Others will take time to put in place, and the situation at the border will not transform overnight, due in large part to the damage done over the last four years.

    "2021 - 2397": "President-elect Biden plans to move quickly to undo the Trump administration\u2019s most cherished agenda items \u2014 including introducing a bill that would allow 11 million illegal immigrants to become permanent US residents, and give them the right to pursue citizenship after an eight-year wait, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-01-15/biden-to-send-congress-bill-to-legalize-11-million-immigrants-who-lack-documentation\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to immigration rights activists</a> who have seen the plans.As expected, Biden also plans to issue an immediate executive order to extend DACA, the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/01/05/dhs-has-approved-171-new-daca-applications-since-november/\">shields young people</a> brought to the US as children from deportation.

The caravan, which includes more than 5,000 people in total, could be the first to reach the US border after Biden takes office.Pueblo Sin Fronteras called on Biden to work with the Mexican government and Central American countries to address the roots of illegal immigration.Biden\u2019s administration needs to \u201cdismantle illegal and inhuman programs such as Remain in Mexico, the United States\u2019 Asylum Cooperation Agreements with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, as well as the Title 42 expulsions by the United States authorities,\u201d it said. The Title 42 program allows Customs and Border Protection officials to immediately expel anyone who crosses the border illegally to their country of last transit.Remain in Mexico, implemented in January 2019, requires U.S. asylum seekers to stay in the country while they wait for their cases to be heard by U.S. immigration courts.Biden\u2019s administration has promised a more humane approach to illegal migrants and a reversal of some of President Trump\u2019s most controversial policies \u2014 but has warned the changes won\u2019t happen overnight.\u00a0\u201cOur priority is to reopen asylum processing at the border consistent with the capacity to do so safely and to protect public health, especially in the context of COVID-19,\u201d Biden policy adviser <a href=\"https://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20201221/6140654/asesores-biden-tardaremos-meses-restablecer-asilo-frontera.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Susan Rice said in a recent interview with Spanish wire service FFE</a>. \u201cThis effort will begin immediately but it will take months to develop the capacity that we will need to reopen fully.\u201d",
    "2021 - 5041": "VADO HONDO, Guatemala \u2014 Guatemalan police and soldiers launched tear gas and wielded batons and shields against a group of Honduran migrants that tried to push through their roadblock early Sunday.A group of about 2,000 migrants had stopped short of the roadblock the night before. The roadblock was strategically placed at a chokepoint on the two-lane highway to Chiquimula in an area known as Vado Hondo. It\u2019s flanked by a tall mountainside and a wall leaving the migrants with few options.Some 100 migrants tried to make their way through authorities around 7:30 a.m. Sunday. The security forces beat them back and deployed tear gas. None made it through and the larger remaining contingent kept its distance during the melee.Some migrants were visibly injured by baton strikes. One man, who did not give his name, leaned against a wall near police with a bandage atop his head.\u201cThey hit me in the head,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t come with the intention of looking for problems with anybody. We\u2019re brothers, Central Americans. We\u2019re not looking for trouble. We just want to pass.\u201dLater, hundreds of migrants sat down on the roadway, refusing to leave and insisting they be allowed through, appealing to the soldiers as fellow Central Americans.Leila Rodriguez, of Guatemala\u2019s human rights office, spoke to the migrants, acknowledging \u201cthis is a distressing moment we\u2019re experiencing.\u201d\u201cWe want to start a dialogue with you, to ask you to accept some of the needs of the Guatemalan people right now,\u201d Rodriguez said, in apparent reference to President Alejandro Giammattei\u2019s refusal to allow caravans through out of fear they could spread COVID-19.Some of the migrants wore face masks, others didn\u2019t, but there was little social distancing among them. Few had the negative COVID-19 tests that Guatemala requires for people entering the country.Guatemala\u2019s Health Ministry reported that 21 of the migrants sought medical attention at health centers and tested positive for the coronavirus. The department said the 12 men and and nine women would not be returned to Honduras until they undergo quarantine at centers in Guatemala.As the standoff stretched toward 24 hours, some migrants, like Ismael Eliazar of Choloma, Honduras, lay down in the grass beside the roadway. \u201cWe have only had water, even my stomach is grumbling,\u201d Eliazar said.Referring to the damage wrought by two major hurricanes that hit his hometown near San Pedro Sula in November, Eliazar said \u201cthere is still mud everywhere there, everything got knocked down, we lost everything.\u201dGuatemalan soldiers and police had blocked part of a caravan of as many as 9,000 Honduran migrants Saturday night at a point not far from where they entered the country, seeking to reach the U.S. border.The soldiers and riot police \u2014 about 450 in total \u2014 formed ranks across a highway.Guatemala\u2019s immigration agency distributed a video showing a couple of hundred men scuffling with soldiers, pushing and running through their lines, even as troops held hundreds more back Saturday night.On Saturday, Giammattei issued a statement calling on Honduran authorities \u201cto contain the mass exit of its inhabitants.\u201d On Friday, the migrants entered Guatemala by pushing past about 2,000 police and soldiers posted at the border; most entered without showing the negative coronavirus test that Guatemala requires.\u201cThe government of Guatemala regrets this violation of national sovereignty and calls on the governments of Central America to take measures to avoid putting their inhabitants at risk amid the health emergency due to the pandemic,\u201d Giammattei\u2019s statement continued.Guatemala has set up almost a dozen control points on highways and may start busing more migrants back to Honduras, as it has done before, arguing they pose a risk to themselves and others by traveling during the coronavirus pandemic.Governments throughout the region have made it clear they will not let the caravan through.Mexico mounted a dissuasive campaign at its southern border, circulating videos and photos of thousands of National Guardsmen and immigration agents preparing if the migrants manage to cross Guatemala.On Saturday, the Mexican Foreign Relations Department issued a statement praising Guatemala\u2019s stance.\u201cThe Mexican government recognizes the outstanding work of the government of Guatemala, which has acted in a firm and responsible manner toward the contingent of migrants that violated its sovereignty,\u201d according to the statement.The department said Mexico \u201crejects any unregulated and disorderly entry that puts at risk the lives and health of the migrant population or the host country.\u201dHonduras has been ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic and the hurricanes that hit the country in November leaving its most productive northern regions in tatters. Many of the migrants hope for a warmer reception from the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden who will be inaugurated Wednesday.So far, Biden\u2019s team has indicated it will not make immediate changes to policies at the US-Mexico border.",
