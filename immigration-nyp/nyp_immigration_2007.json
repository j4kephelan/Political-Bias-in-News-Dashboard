    "2007 - 1943": "They scrimped and saved to buy a home on Long Island\u2019s tony North Shore so their sons could go to good schools \u2013 and she could be a stay-at-home mom to greet the boys every afternoon.   But when two brothers opened the door to their Syosset home Tuesday, they discovered the suburban dream their immigrant parents had toiled for 20 years to realize had turned into a nightmare.   Josh Singh, 13, and his little brother, Ankur, remained surrounded by devastated friends and family yesterday, as police struggled for clues as to why Jaspal and Geeta Singh, were shot dead.   \u201cThe boys are OK. The boys are with me,\u201d was all their uncle, Joginder Singh, could say outside his home in nearby Bethpage before being overcome with grief.   The boys came home to the Doone Drive home from school Tuesday to find their father\u2019s body downstairs and their mother lying in an upstairs bedroom.   The couple had moved into the home just eight months ago after saving every penny they could from Jaspal\u2019s gas station and his full-time job at a Manhattan mattress store.   Workers at Economy Foam in Greenwich Village said Jaspal had worked there for nearly 20 years after emigrating from the Punjab, in India.   \u201cEverybody who worked here loved [Jaspal]. He knew how to interact with people,\u201d said the store\u2019s owner, who declined to give her name.   Stock manager Arshad Mahmood, 46, said Jaspal was overjoyed to move out of the family\u2019s Queens house for the leafy suburb of Syosset.   \u201cWe knew he moved to where he moved because he wanted good schools,\u201d Mahmood said.   Jaspal, from a wealthy Punjabi family, owned a gas station with his brother. Documents show that over the years the family had earned enough to buy the Syosset house while the Queens one remained on the market.   Nassau County cops yesterday remained baffled as to why the couple was shot. <em><a class=\"a10blb\" href=\"mailto:kieran.crowley@nypost.com\">kieran.crowley@nypost.com</a></em>",
    "2007 - 1363": "A Brooklyn man at a Long Island recycling center accidentally crushed a co-worker \u2013 his father \u2013 to death yesterday under the wheels of a hulking payloader, police said.   Luis Marquez, 25, his brother, Jos\u00e9, 32, and their father, Miguel, 58, were working the night shift at Omni Recycling in West Babylon, cops said.   At about 1:30 a.m., foreman Marco Jimbo said, \u201cLuis was working the payloader and feels something, a bump. He got out . . . to see what happened.\u201d   Miguel lay bloodied and motionless.   \u201cWe would have been married 37 years this August,\u201d said his weeping widow, Maria Remache.   Luis Marquez was too devastated to speak to reporters in the Ecuadorean immigrant family\u2019s home.   Omni Recycling reps declined to comment and advised workers not to talk.   But one spoke, anonymously, of daily risks.   \u201cThere\u2019s so much going on around you, so much heavy stuff everywhere . . . You have to watch out, especially at night,\u201d he said.   In 1998, a worker fell to his death from a sorting machine. The next year, one fell from a mountain of trash into a drainage hole and died. Both were Salvadoran immigrants.   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has fined Omni twice for safety violations \u2013 and is investigating the death of Miguel Marquez.<em><a class=\"a10blb\" href=\"mailto:patrick.white@nypost.com\">patrick.white@nypost.com</a></em>",
    "2007 - 2684": "The sexy Mexican model at the center of a love triangle and extortion lawsuit involving a top fashion photographer and a jeans designer has been married to yet another man for the past two years, court papers say.   Fernanda Romero tied the knot with the unidentified actor in 2005 in a marriage that was arranged by her jealous former fianc\u00e9, Rock &amp; Republic CEO Michael Ball, the filings say.   The union \u201cwas a fraudulent marriage for immigration purposes,\u201d the suit says.   Ball was sued earlier this week by shutterbug Markus Klinko in a $500,000 breach-of-contract action.   Klinko alleged that the self-proclaimed \u201cSuper Jefe\u201d Ball backed out of a business deal and tried to extort him with X-rated pictures.   The dispute allegedly came after Ball found out Klinko was dating Romero.   \u201cFueled by jealousies over an ex-fianc\u00e9e [who] abandoned Ball and who subsequently entered into a long-term romantic relationship\u201d with Klinko, Ball \u201cembarked on a crusade to intimidate Klinko personally and professionally,\u201d the suit says.   \u201cThis is about protecting my business and my reputation. I\u2019m defending myself,\u201d said Klinko, who\u2019s worked with the likes of Janet Jackson, Britney Spears and Mariah Carey.   \u201cIt\u2019s about standing up to a bully,\u201d added his lawyer, Anthony LoPresti.   Klinko said his former gal pal Romero, 24, told him she and Ball had a \u201ctortured\u201d relationship over the years.   They met in Mexico when Romero was in a teen singing group, and she soon moved in with him, Klinko said.   He said Romero found the relationship \u201cawkward\u201d because they were living in the same Los Angeles house as Ball\u2019s business partner \u2013 his former girlfriend.   The couple got engaged, but the relationship then soured. Klinko\u2019s suit said there were \u201cinstances of violence by Ball leading to police involvement.\u201d   They broke up in 2005 after Romero went to Europe and had a tryst \u201cwith a Frenchman,\u201d Klinko said.   Later that year, Ball helped her set up her sham marriage, the suit says.   Klinko started dating Romero in January 2006. When he met Ball last month about doing an ad campaign for his company, Romero urged him to keep their relationship under wraps.   Ball was floored by Klinko\u2019s work and said he wanted a long-term partnership \u2013 but flipped out when he later found out about Klinko\u2019s \u201cpartnership\u201d with Romero.   He got a hold of pictures that Klinko had e-mailed Romero of himself with two other women for \u201ca self-portrait sex book\u201d he was working on.   Bell then allegedly threatened to make them public unless Klinko \u201cbacked off\u201d from both Romero and the deal.<em><a class=\"a10blb\" href=\"mailto:dareh.gregorian@nypost.com\">dareh.gregorian@nypost.com</a></em>",
    "2007 - 2054": "The NYPD won\u2019t give Ken Boss back his gun, but the cop involved in the fatal Amadou Diallo shooting got one from the Marines \u2013 and used it to kill two insurgents in Iraq last year.   And in one of those firefights, an unarmed cab driver was shot dead.   The reservist served a seven-month tour in Fallujah ending in October, during which he led a four-man Humvee team that patrolled one of the most dangerous regions of the war-torn country.   In May, then-Pfc. Boss flagged down a suspicious car on a Fallujah street.   Gripping his M4 automatic rifle, Boss was approaching the driver when a passenger darted from the vehicle. Momentarily distracted, Boss didn\u2019t notice that the driver had opened his door and was holding a 9 mm handgun.   \u201cOnce that happened, I thought, \u2018They got me,\u2019 \u201d Boss, 35, told The Post.   A single shot hit Boss in the chest, hurling him to the ground. But the bullet, miraculously, lodged in the Marine\u2019s GPS device tucked into his flak jacket, he said.   Boss, uninjured, returned fire, striking the insurgent with a burst of three bullets, he said.   Fellow Marines then fired at the armed passenger, killing him.   A cab driver sitting in an idling taxi behind the insurgents\u2019 vehicle, died in the hail of bullets.   \u201cEverybody felt terrible about it,\u201d Boss recalled. \u201cUnfortunately, that\u2019s how it happens. Rounds go through vehicles.\u201d   At home, Boss is still assigned to desk duty.   On Feb. 4, 1999, Boss and three other undercover officers fired 41 bullets at Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant they mistakenly thought was holding a gun.   While the four cops were acquitted of criminal charges, the department has never allowed them to return to active duty.   Boss revealed he was in the middle of another fatal fight in late August, when he gunned down a grenade-wielding terrorist who had just killed an Iraqi police officer.   The Ronkonkoma, L.I., reservist earned a field promotion to lance corporal during his tour.<em><a class=\"a10blb\" href=\"mailto:frank.ryan@nypost.com\">frank.ryan@nypost.com</a></em>",
    "2007 - 1553": "The number of patients treated at a city health clinic aimed at 9/11- related illnesses has skyrocketed 60 percent in just three months, The Post has learned.   The Bellevue Hospital/NYU School of Medicine clinic has enrolled more than 300 additional patients since Mayor Bloomberg\u2019s announcement last fall of plans for a $16 million program expansion. It now serves more than 800 patients.   \u201cWe\u2019re finding people predominantly with upper- and lower-respiratory problems,\u201d said clinic director Dr. Joan Reibman. \u201cWe\u2019re getting more office workers and people who were caught up in the dust cloud.\u201d   Symptoms include asthma, sinusitis and shortness of breath, Reibman said. Bellevue had focused on treating downtown residents and office workers but now has the resources to see many more patients. Mount Sinai Hospital\u2019s 9/11 monitoring program has treated thousands of rescue and office workers.   The mayor and Health and Hospitals Corp. President Alan Aviles are expected to officially unveil the expanded Bellevue center this week. It will have more clinical space and beefed up staffing to eventually treat 6,000 patients exposed to Ground Zero contaminants.   \u201cThe center will significantly expand services that HHC has been providing to [World Trade Center]-impacted patients who are uninsured or otherwise ineligible for financial assistance for medical treatment,\u201d Aviles said.   And the staff will have more bilingual members to help treat immigrants.   \u201cWe will make sure patients get the medication they need,\u201d said Bellevue CEO Terry Miles.",
    "2007 - 2749": " The feds yesterday finally stuck it to the only member of John \u201cTeflon Don\u201d Gotti\u2019s murderous inner circle who had never been busted.   Infamous reputed Gambino capo George \u201cButter\u201d DeCicco was among 13 alleged crime-family thugs nailed for a slew of extortion, racketeering, loan-sharking and money-laundering raps after a two-year probe fueled by a Mafia mole, authorities said.   The federal case will involve hundreds of hours of damning tapes made with the help of the turncoat witness, a member of DeCicco\u2019s crew, FBI officials said.   On one tape, the bloodthirsty DeCicco, 77, is heard warning the snitch, \u201cI\u2019ll burn your eyes out,\u201d officials said. In another taped chat between the witness and DeCicco\u2019s nephew, alleged Gambino soldier Joseph \u201cJoey Boy\u201d Orlando, investigators say Orlando all but admits to committing eight murders when he says: \u201cI\u2019ve got eight under my belt, and I don\u2019t give a [expletive] who becomes the ninth.\u201d   One Mafioso is caught on tape gushing about one of three brutal murders he\u2019s committed, authorities said. \u201cI shot him in the leg first, and he went down screaming,\u201d Steven \u201cSteve Rigatoni\u201d Famiglietta is heard boasting to the mole, officials said. \u201cAnd then I started taking his arm off with a chain saw . . . He felt every f- \u2013 -ing thing I did to him.\u201d   The feds said the mobsters\u2019 downfall evolved from a simple scheme gone awry. It involved Orlando asking DeCicco\u2019s crew for help landing an immigration green card for his girlfriend.   One thug in the group said he could help \u2013 then panicked when he realized he couldn\u2019t pull off the request. Fearing for his life, he went to the feds offering his services. The authorities set up an undercover agent as an immigration official and, with the help of their now-cooperating witness, offered the services of the undercover to the mob. But by then, the Mafiosi had a more pressing problem.   DeCicco had been asked by top Sicilian mobsters to keep their countryman, Francesco Nania, who was in U.S. custody, from being deported to face mob-related charges back home.   The Gambinos eventually offered $70,000 to the undercover to broker the immigration deal, officials said.   Also busted was DeCicco\u2019s son, Robert, who is in his 50s.   George DeCicco\u2019s lawyer said he will seek house arrest for his client because DeCicco has heart problems and wears a nitroglycerin patch.   DeCicco is the brother of the notorious late Frank DeCicco, who lured then-Gambino chief Paul Castellano to his rubout outside Sparks steakhouse on East 46th Street in 1985.   Frank DeCicco wound up dead a little over a year later \u2013 killed by a car bomb meant for his boss, Gotti.<em><a class=\"a10blb\" href=\"mailto:stefanie.cohen@nypost.com\">stefanie.cohen@nypost.com</a></em>",
    "2007 - 2261": " A vengeful Bronx woman, hellbent on torching her beau, started a fire yesterday that killed a little girl living upstairs, law-enforcement sources said.   Sharon Scott \u2013 busted last year for stabbing boyfriend James Hicks \u2013 confessed to cops she poured nail-polish remover on the couple\u2019s bed and lit it as Hicks was sleeping, the sources said.   As the flames began to erupt, Hicks, 49, woke up, grabbed Scott, 32, and they fled the burning apartment on the fifth floor of 4 Jesup Place, a six-story apartment building in Morris Heights.   Sadly, the flames and smoke spread up to the sixth-floor apartment where 2-year-old Amanda Adgivon \u2013 described by her godmother as \u201can amazing little girl\u201d \u2013 was asleep.   Her father, Komi, 41, his lungs filled with smoke, tried to save the little girl, but both collapsed in the hallway outside their apartment, an FDNY battalion chief said.   \u201cThey were not in good shape,\u201d he said.   Amanda was pronounced dead on arrival at Bronx Lebanon Hospital about 7:30 a.m. Her father, an immigrant from Africa, was in serious condition. Five firefighters had minor injuries.   Tears running down her cheeks, Amanda\u2019s mother, Dolibe, 37, asked, \u201cWhy did my child have to pay with her life?\u201d   She became so upset she couldn\u2019t go on speaking.   Later, when her husband regained consciousness, she had the sad task of telling him their baby was dead.   Amanda\u2019s aunt, Helen Adzor, was filled with anger at Scott and Hicks.   \u201cThey should be put in jail,\u201d she raged.   The law-enforcement sources said the couple had a stormy relationship, with 27 arrests between them, many for attacks on each other, including the stabbing last year.   Scott was charged last night with murder and arson. Tuesday was her birthday, and neighbors said the fire followed a night of partying and fighting.   Adzor said at one point, Hicks kicked Scott out of the apartment.   Before being taken in for questioning, Hicks spoke briefly with reporters. He looked dazed and bug-eyed and his hair was wild.   \u201cAll I saw were flames on my bed. It was on fire,\u201d he said. \u201cI tried to get some water to put the fire out, but it was too smoky. So I got Sharon out.\u201d<em><a class=\"a10blb\" href=\"mailto:murray.weiss@nypost.com\">murray.weiss@nypost.com</a></em>",
