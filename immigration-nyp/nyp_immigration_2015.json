    "2015 - 2069": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The guest list hasn\u2019t changed, but President Barack Obama faces a different type of crowd when he meets with congressional leaders on Tuesday.Obama\u2019s sit-down with House and Senate leaders is his first since the new, fully Republican-run Congress was seated last week. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, long Obama\u2019s stronghold in the Senate, was demoted by the November elections to minority leader. GOP leader Mitch McConnell, a persistent thorn in Obama\u2019s side as minority leader, now has Reid\u2019s old job running the upper chamber.The three were to join House Speaker John Boehner and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi in the Oval Office to discuss opportunities for potential cooperation between Democrats and Republicans this year. Yet it was far from clear that the two parties would be able to overlook their open disagreements on most issues to focus on limited areas of common ground.Both parties exited the midterms last year speaking optimistically about working together on tax reform, trade promotion and infrastructure development \u2014 areas where Obama and Republicans see at least partially eye to eye. But the start of the year has been dominated by familiar battles over the Keystone XL pipeline, Obama\u2019s immigration actions and foreign policy.Over the last two weeks, Obama has repeatedly threatened to veto bills that Republicans have put forward as their top priorities for the new Congress. Still, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said there were a \u201cwhole host of things\u201d that Obama could do this year with Republicans.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re gonna agree on everything \u2014 certainly we\u2019re not,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cBut the question is, are we going to allow disagreement over a few things to become a deal-breaker for all the others?\u201d\u201cThe president certainly hopes that it won\u2019t,\u201d he added.Although the Democratic and Republican leaders from both chambers were invited, it was unclear whether Reid would show. The Nevada Democrat is recovering from an exercise-related injury and his spokesman declined to say whether he planned to attend.",

    "2015 - 3388": "SANTA ANA, Calif. \u2014 The Mexican government on Thursday will start issuing birth certificates to its citizens at consulates in the United States, seeking to make it easier for them to apply for U.S. work permits, driver\u2019s licenses and protection from deportation.Until now, Mexico has required citizens to get birth certificates at government offices in Mexico. Many of those living in the U.S. ask friends and relatives back home to retrieve them, which can delay their applications for immigration or other programs.Now, even as Republicans in Congress try to quash President Barack Obama\u2019s reprieve to millions of immigrants living illegally in the U.S., Mexico is trying to help them apply for programs that would allow them to remain temporarily in the country and continue sending money back to relatives across the border.\u201cIt is a huge help. It helps individuals really begin to formulate their formal identity in this country,\u201d said Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles.About half of the 11 million immigrants living in the United States illegally are from Mexico, and immigration experts estimate that roughly 3 million Mexicans could be eligible to apply for work permits and protection from deportation under the administration\u2019s plan.About two weeks ago, California \u2013 which is home to more Mexicans than any other state \u2013 began issuing driver\u2019s licenses to immigrants in the country illegally.Starting Thursday, the country\u2019s 50 consulates in the United States will be able to access data maintained by regional governments in Mexico and print birth certificates at the consulates, said Arturo Sanchez, consul for press and commercial affairs in Santa Ana, California.Consulates should be able to issue birth certificates for nearly all birthplaces in Mexico, but some rural villages where documents are not digitally recorded may not be covered, Sanchez said.Over the past year, the Santa Ana consulate has seen a surge in the demand for documents. Daily appointments have jumped by a third to nearly 400, with many people trying to get birth certificates, Sanchez said.Mexican immigrants usually seek birth certificates to obtain a passport or consular identification card so they can then apply for a driver\u2019s license or immigration relief, he said.In California, Mexican consular officials have supported the rollout of the new driver\u2019s license program, holding information sessions and offering test preparation classes to help immigrants pass the written test required to get a license.Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, said she believes Mexico is trying to make it easier for its citizens to stay here because of the money they send across the border.Mexican migrant workers, many who live in the United States, sent home $21.6 billion to their families in 2013, according to the country\u2019s central bank.Vaughan, whose organization advocates for tighter limits on immigration, said the integrity of birth certificates is critical because they are used to issue key identity documents like passports.\u201cIf we can trust the Mexican government to do its due diligence and establish a system with integrity, then this will work and it is up to us to make sure we are communicating with them about what we need to see in terms of integrity,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is a big if.\u201d",
    "2015 - 5345": "Belgian police killed two men who opened fire on them during one of about a dozen raids on Thursday against an Islamist group that federal prosecutors said was about to launch \u201cterrorist attacks on a grand scale\u201d.Coming a week after Islamist gunmen killed 17 people in Paris, the incident fueled fears across Europe of young Muslims returning radicalized from Syria. But the Belgian probe had been under way before the Jan. 7 attack on French satirical newspaper <a href=\"https://nypost.com/tag/charlie-hebdo-massacre/\">Charlie Hebdo</a> and officials saw no obvious link between the two.A third man was detained in the eastern city of Verviers, where police commandos ran into a hail of gunfire after trying to gain entry to an apartment above a town center bakery. All three were citizens of Belgium, which has one of the biggest concentrations of European Islamists fighting in Syria.Other raids on the homes of men returned from the civil war there were conducted across the country, prosecutors said, adding that they were suspected of planning attacks on Belgian police stations. Security had been tightened at such sites.\u201cThe searches were carried out as part of an investigation into an operational cell some of whose members had returned from Syria,\u201d said prosecutors\u2019 spokesman Eric Van Der Sypt. \u201cFor the time being, there is no connection with the attacks in Paris.\u201dDescribing events in the quiet provincial town just after dark, he said: \u201cThe suspects immediately and for several minutes opened fire with military weaponry and handguns on the special units of the federal police before they were neutralized.\u201dEarlier in the day, in an apparently unrelated development, police detained a man in southern Belgium whom they suspected of supplying weaponry to Amedy Coulibaly, killer of four people at a Paris Jewish grocery after the Charlie Hebdo attack.With half a million Muslims, mostly of French-speaking North African descent, among its 11 million people, Belgium has seen similar discontent to that in France among young, unemployed children of immigrants in blighted, post-industrial towns like Verviers, once a major center for wool and other textile mills.<a class=\"\" href=\"https://vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/01/belgium3.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-8568884\" height=\"200\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"https://vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/01/belgium3.jpg?w=300\" srcset=\"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/01/belgium3.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=600 600w, https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/01/belgium3.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=450 450w, https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/01/belgium3.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=300 300w, https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/01/belgium3.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=150 150w, https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/01/belgium3.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all 1024w\" width=\"300\"/></a>A young Frenchman of Algerian origin is facing trial in Belgium, accused of <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2014/05/25/belgium-launches-manhunt-in-jewish-museum-shooting/\">shooting dead four people at the Jewish Museum</a> in the capital Brussels last May.Per head of population, more Belgians have taken part in the fighting in Syria than any other European state.

    "2015 - 3192": "President Obama will propose a plan to raise $320 billion over the next 10 years \u2014 by raising taxes on America\u2019s wealthiest individuals and biggest financial institutions.The massive tax proposal, to be announced Tuesday night in the president\u2019s State of the Union address, will include a hike in the capital-gains rate and the elimination of a tax break on inheritances, and would fund some$235 billion in new tax breaks for the middle class over a decade.The proposal is expected to be cheered by the Democratic Party\u2019s liberal base.But while Republican leaders have said they share Obama\u2019s desire to reform the nation\u2019s complicated tax code, the capital-gains and inheritance-tax \u201creforms\u201d are expected to be nonstarters in the new, GOP-controlled Congress.As a centerpiece of the plan, the capital-gains rate on couples making more than $500,000 a year would be raised to 28 percent. In touting the plan Saturday, \u00adsenior administration officials noted that a 28 percent top capital-gains rate would bring it to the level it was under President Ronald Reagan.But Obama during his presidency has already raised the top capital-gains rate from 15 percent to 23.8 percent \u2014 and hiking it further would almost certainly lead to GOP push-back.The administration also wants to close what it calls the \u201ctrust-fund loophole\u201d by requiring \u00adestates to pay capital-gains taxes on securities at the time they\u2019re inherited.Administration officials are \u00adinsisting that change would impact only the top 1 percent of income earners, but it\u2019s still \u00adanother likely bone of contention among conservatives.Most Republicans want to lower the capital-gains tax or eliminate it entirely, and also want to end taxes on estates rather than \u00adexpand them.Perhaps more palatable to Republicans will be the president\u2019s planned proposal for new fees on the roughly 100 US financial firms with assets of more than $50 billion.The fee would be similar to one proposed last year by then-House Ways and Means Committee head Rep. Dave Camp (R-Mich.), \u00adalthough Camp\u2019s plan was part of a larger proposal to lower the overall corporate income-tax rate.The new revenue generated by Obama\u2019s plan would be put to use funding a series of measures aimed at aiding middle-class Americans.One measure would extend tax credits of up to $500 for families in which both parents work and with annual incomes of up to $210,000.Another measure would expand the child-care tax credit to up to $3,000 for each child under the age of 5. More than 5 million families would benefit from that \u00adreform, officials said.Yet another measure would overhaul the education tax system by consolidating six provisions into two. That overhaul would cut taxes for some 8.5 million families, officials said.Republicans aren\u2019t rattling their sabers on the reforms just yet, despite their anger over the president\u2019s vows to veto party priorities including the Keystone XL oil pipeline, GOP plans for ratcheting back ObamaCare and blocking his executive actions on immigration.\u201cThis can be a moment the president pivots to a positive posture,\u201d new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said of the president\u2019s State of the Union speech. <em>With AP</em>",

The troll\u2019s provocation produces spittle-filled ad hominem responses from his enemies, who go over the top with their outrage.That outrage in turn generates passionate support for the troll from people who agree with him generally. They then join the battle on his side by directing even more ad hominem nastiness at the other guys. And the troll grins and giggles and collects his clicks.The liberal writer Bill Scher thinks this is good politics. \u201cFortunately for Obama,\u201d Scher wrote just after the November 2014 midterms, \u201cbringing out the worst in Republicans serves both his political and his policy purposes.\u201dThe problem with that theory is Obama\u2019s own political instincts are pretty bad, except when it comes to his own immediate self-preservation.The president could have gone one of two ways after the midterms, in which his party lost control of the Senate in a wave that really could not have gone better for Republicans.First, he could have looked at some alarming data and noted how he is practically the only elected Democrat in the country who has benefited from his presidency. Since 2010, the Democratic Party has lost 69 seats in the House of Representatives and 14 Senate seats \u2014 and a staggering 913 seats in the state legislatures.Among presidents, \u201cIt is Barack Obama who holds the modern record for overall losses, at least through 2014,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/12/presidents-bad-for-their-parties-113241.html#.VLrf_EfF9ig\">writes Larry Sabato</a> of the University of Virginia.In the House and state legislatures, \u201cObama has doubled (or more) the average two-term presidential loss from Truman through Bush.\u201dThis Democratic political wipeout, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/01/14/republicans-have-gained-more-than-900-state-legislative-seats-since-2010/\">says Chris Cillizza of The Washington Post</a>, is \u201cthe most undertold story in politics.\u201dWhat that story suggests is not that the president should be trolling his opponents, but that he should be doing what he can to find common ground \u2014 if only to save his party from further destruction.Tuesday night\u2019s State of the Union address could be the first one in history deliberately designed solely to generate a Pavlovian rage response in members of the opposing party.But that is not where he has gone. Instead, he has doubled down on presidential unilateralism and executive authority.He has done this because it\u2019s what he likes and wants to do. It has long been a conscious choice of this White House to pursue what David Plouffe, a key Obama adviser, called the \u201cstray voltage theory.\u201dMajor Garrett, then of National Journal and now of CBS, <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/all-powers/the-pen-phone-and-stray-voltage-20140416\">explained it in early 2014</a>: \u201cThe theory goes like this: Controversy sparks attention, attention provokes conversation, and conversation embeds previously unknown or marginalized ideas in the public consciousness.This happens, Plouffe theorizes, even when \u2014 and sometimes especially when \u2014 the White House appears defensive, besieged or off-guard.\u201dYou can see how convenient such a theory is, since it works even when the White House appears to have blown it!But this stray voltage has done nothing for any of his allies on Capitol Hill and has hardly advanced the liberal Democratic agenda.Ah, you might say, but Obama was re-elected and he used \u201cstray voltage\u201d to his advantage, so someone was helped! Not necessarily.Most serious students of the 2012 election, including supporters and allies of the president, now believe his victory was primarily due to so-called \u201cfundamentals\u201d favoring him \u2014 the benefits of incumbency and the condition of the economy in the months leading up to the election.As <a href=\"http://themonkeycage.org/2012/11/08/more-evidence-that-obamas-victory-reflects-the-economy-fundamentals/\">Joshua Tucker of New York University pointed out</a> in November 2012, \u201cthe [economic] growth rate between January and September of 2012 averaged 1.8%,\u201d and using a \u201cfundamentals\u201d formula, \u201cthis yielded a predicted share of 51.2% of the two-party vote for incumbent Obama.\u201d Which was almost exactly what he won on Election Night.Meanwhile, his years as president have led to Republicans controlling 30 state legislatures, the most for the GOP since 1920. That\u2019s not only bad for the cultivation of future Democratic Party leaders. It makes the furtherance of a liberal agenda at the state level nearly impossible over the next few years.As Cillizza writes, \u201cPolicy is made at the state legislative level. That\u2019s policy pertaining to states and policy that gets bumped up to the federal level. With Republicans in control of so many state governments, the policy incubator for their side will be vastly superior to what Democrats can do at the state and local levels.\u201dThe only real data point in the president\u2019s favor \u2014 and it is a significant one \u2014 came out in polling from CBS News late last week.Support for his immigration plan is startlingly high; 62% favor while only 34% oppose. Democrats are overwhelmingly on his side (79% to 18%), while Republicans oppose it but with less force (57% against and 37% for). Most important, independents back it, 63% to 32%.What this means is that when it comes to immigration the president is not engaging in \u201cstray voltage\u201d behavior. Rather, he is closer to the center of American public opinion than Republicans are.Might it not have been better both for the body politic and for his party\u2019s own standing with the American people if the president had made his full-court press on immigration matters without going all stray voltage and seeking to get Republicans to blow their stack?With numbers like these, he could have won an argument \u2014 by enlisting the American people in the effort, putting the GOP on the defensive in its opposition to his policies, and possibly splitting the rival party.But that\u2019s not how Barack Obama rolls \u2014 or, rather, trolls.",

Gulab has said Luttrell offered to help him obtain a green card, but the relationship between the two men appears to have become strained while Gulab was visiting the US last year for the premiere of \u201cLone Survivor.\u201d When contacted by FoxNews.com, Lutrell declined to comment on Gulab or his bid for asylum.He is not safe until he\u2019s on US soil.For now, Gulab\u2019s hopes rest with Michael Wildes, a New York-based immigration attorney who has taken the case for free.\u201cThe Department of Homeland Security is currently reviewing his file to determine whether or not they would put in a request with the United Nations to have him relocated to US based on what he did,\u201d Wildes told FoxNews.com.DHS officials did not return calls seeking comment.Wildes added that, although he has managed to get Gulab out of Afghanistan and into an undisclosed third country, it is still urgent that Gulab be given asylum in the US.\u201cHe is not safe until he\u2019s on US soil,\u201d Wildes said. \u201cI am prayerful this will happen soon.\u201dIf Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson finds Gulab\u2019s bid for asylum worthy, the department would submit the request to the UN. If approved by the world body, Gulab will be allowed to come to the US and seek asylum, said Wildes.\u201cThat\u2019s as simple as it takes \u2026 I wish it would happen as instinctively as Mohammad Gulab gave Marcus Luttrell safety. We should be returning that same sentiment,\u201d he said.Since the story was first reported by CBS News, some have noted that Gulab visited America before, and have questioned why he did not apply for asylum then if his life is at such risk. Gulab visted once in 2010 when Luttrell paid for a round-trip ticket so that he could come visit, and again in 2013 when Universal Studios paid for him to come to the premiere of \u201cLone Survivor,\u201d which features him saving Luttrell.Wildes said that circumstances have gotten much more dangerous for Gulab with the release of the movie.\u201c[The problem] became more acute over time,\u201d Wildes said.<a name=\"024ef8d103589c02212e7b399fc9756d-56757169-54652663\"></a>"
