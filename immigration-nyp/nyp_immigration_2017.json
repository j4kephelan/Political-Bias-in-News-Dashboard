    "2017 - 3590": "LONDON \u2014 British Prime Minister Theresa May has made it clear: the U.K. will make a clean break from the European Union and leave its single market of some 500 million people.In her most direct remarks since the June 23 vote, May said Tuesday that Britain must regain control of its laws and borders, even as she called on the bloc to negotiate a free-trade agreement that will benefit both sides.\u201cWe do not seek membership of the single market,\u201d she said in a highly anticipated speech. \u201cInstead, we seek the greatest possible access to it through a new, comprehensive, bold and ambitious Free Trade Agreement.\u201dMay also made the EU an offer \u2014 she hopes \u2014 that it can\u2019t refuse: arguing that a \u201ccliff-edge for business or a threat to stability\u201d is good for neither Europe nor Britain.\u201cI know there are some voices calling for a punitive deal that punishes Britain and discourages other countries from taking the same path,\u201d she said. \u201cThat would be an act of calamitous self-harm for the countries of Europe. And it would not be the act of a friend.\u201dMay also acknowledged for the first time that Britain\u2019s Parliament will be able to vote on the final divorce deal reached between the U.K. and European Union. However, she did not address what would happen should there be a vote against the agreement.The British pound rallied as May focused on keeping Britain open to global trade. The currency was recovering from steep losses earlier in the week, trading 2.2 percent higher at $1.2309. On Monday, it was as low as $1.20, a near 31-year low.The plunge in the pound has started to hit the consumer. Inflation in Britain has soared to its highest level in 2 \u00bd years, hitting 1.6 percent in December, from 1.2 percent in November.May rejected both the \u201chard Brexit\u201d label and its opposite, a compromise \u201csoft Brexit\u201d \u2014 but wants a new relationship in the interests of both Britain and the EU.\u201cWe want to buy your goods, sell you ours, trade with you as freely as possible, and work with one another to make sure we are all safer, more secure and more prosperous through continued friendship,\u201d she said.In a bid to alleviate fears that Brexit will mean a more insular Britain, May said she wants the country to be \u201cstronger, fairer, more united and more outward-looking than ever before.\u201dIn an attempt to symbolize the U.K.\u2019s outward-facing aspirations, May spoke before an audience of British civil servants and international diplomats at London\u2019s Lancaster House, a Georgian mansion that has hosted international summits.Britain is quitting the EU\u2019s single market in goods and services in order to gain control over immigration \u2014 a key issue for many voters who backed Brexit. EU leaders say Britain can\u2019t stay in the single market without allowing free movement of people from the bloc.Losing single-market access alarms many in Britain\u2019s huge financial services sector, which relies on an ability to do business seamlessly across the 28-nation bloc. It also worries the many foreign firms that use London not only as a financial hub but as an entry point into the EU.May said she would invoke Article 50 of the EU\u2019s key treat by March 31, to formally begin a two-year process of negotiating Britain\u2019s departure. But she has until now refused to reveal details about the government\u2019s goals or negotiating strategy, arguing that to do so would weaken Britain\u2019s hand.May also used her speech to appeal for reconciliation between the 48 percent of British voters who wanted to stay in the EU and the pro-Brexit 52 percent. But the gap between \u201cremainers\u201d and \u201cleavers\u201d appears as wide as ever.",
    "2017 - 3921": "Washington will turn into a virtual fortress ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential inauguration on Friday, as the US capital braces for more than a quarter-million protesters expected during the Republican\u2019s swearing-in.Police have forecast that some 900,000 people, both supporters and opponents, will flood Washington for the inauguration ceremony, which includes the swearing-in on the steps of the US Capitol and a parade to the White House along streets thronged with onlookers.Many of those attending will be protesters irate about the New York real estate developer\u2019s demeaning comments about women, immigrants and Muslims, a vow to repeal the sweeping health care reform law known as ObamaCare and plans to build a wall along the US-Mexico border.His supporters admire Trump\u2019s experience in business, including as a real estate developer and reality television star, and view him as an outsider and problem-solver.About 28,000 security personnel, miles of fencing, roadblocks, street barricades and dump trucks laden with sand will be part of the security cordon clamped around 3 square miles (almost 8 square kilometers) of central Washington.About 30 groups that organizers claim will draw about 270,000 protesters or Trump backers have received permits for rallies or marches before, during and after the swearing-in. More protests are expected without permits.By far the biggest protest will be the Women\u2019s March on Washington on Saturday, which organizers expect to draw 250,000 people.Hundreds of Women\u2019s March-related protests are scheduled across the United States and around the world as well.An anti-Trump protest also is scheduled for New York on Thursday evening when Mayor Bill de Blasio, filmmaker Michael Moore and actors Mark Ruffalo and Alec Baldwin, who portrays Trump on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d take part in a rally outside the Trump International Hotel and Tower.A major group of protesters, Disrupt J20, has vowed to stage demonstrations at each of 12 security checkpoints and block access to the festivities on the grassy National Mall.One Washington inaugural protest will come amid a haze of pot smoke as pro-marijuana protesters show their opposition to Trump\u2019s choice for attorney general, Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions, a critic of pot legalization.The group plans to distribute 4,200 joints at the inauguration and urge attendees to light up. Possession of small amounts of marijuana is legal in Washington, but public consumption is not.Interim Police Chief Peter Newsham said officers were prepared to carry out mass arrests, though authorities hoped that would not be necessary.\u201cIf we do have a mass arrest, we\u2019ll be able to get people processed very quickly,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/DC-Police-Prepared-for-Busy-Inauguration-Weekend_Washington-DC-411005465.html\">he said in an interview</a> with Washington\u2019s NBC 4 television station.Police and security officials have said repeatedly they are committed to guaranteeing protesters\u2019 constitutional rights to free speech and peaceable assembly.Friday\u2019s crowds are expected to be less than the 2 million who attended Obama\u2019s first inauguration in 2009, and in line with the million who were at his second, four years ago.The inaugural parade down Pennsylvania Avenue will pass the Trump International Hotel, a rallying point for protesters since the election now encircled by security fences.In a sign of the Trump-related angst gripping Washington, the dean of Washington National Cathedral said this week its choir would sing \u201cGod Bless America\u201d at the inauguration despite misgivings by some members.\u201cLet me be clear: We are not singing for the president. We are singing for God because that is what church choirs do,\u201d the Rev. Randolph Marshall Hollerith said in a letter.Trump will attend an interfaith prayer service at the cathedral Saturday, which will bring to a close the inaugural ceremonies.",
    "2017 - 1890": "An army of protesters has one goal for Inauguration Day \u2014 disrupt Trump.DisruptJ20, an umbrella organization that is coordinating anti-Trump events with more than 90 different groups, has spent weeks plotting how to \u201cshut down\u201d Washington, D.C., on Friday.\u201cWe\u2019re not just organizing some boring-ass march,\u201d Legba Carrefour, one of the group\u2019s organizers, <a href=\"http://www.vocativ.com/393923/disruptj20-donald-trump-inauguration-protest-activists-washington-dc/\">told Vocativ</a>. \u201cWe want direct action.\u201dThe group has a series of disruptive, but peaceful protests planned for Friday starting with an \u201canti-capitalist march\u201d at 10 a.m.They have plotted people throughout the parade route to stage \u201ccolorful disruptions\u201d on specific topics like climate, racial injustice and immigrant rights, another organizer said.Part of their plan also includes creating traffic nightmares by forming human blockades on various highways in Washington DC.A week before the inauguration, about 100 activists gathered at American University for classes on what to do if they are arrested, studying past successful protests and how to stay organized on the big day.At the Getting Arrested 101 class, a lawyer shared tips with the packed classroom including bringing at least $100 in cash, carrying three days worth of any prescribed medications in their original bottles and jotting down DisruptJ20\u2019s legal team\u2019s number on their arm.The lawyer also ran through a list of \u201cdo\u2019s\u201d and \u201cdont\u2019s\u201d when getting cuffed, encouraging protesters to record their arrest and keep their hands visible at all times, but not to touch cops.\u201cIn my 20 years of doing radical activism, I\u2019ve never seen an uprise, or a social unrest like I have with this,\u201d Carrefour said. \u201cAnd for good reason.\u201dBut while the activists are ironing out the details of their own protest plans, there are others that are scheming to disrupt them.",
    "2017 - 3264": "Tech billionaire Peter Thiel has been in talks to become US ambassador to Germany for the Trump administration, sources told The Post.The Trump team could fill the top diplomatic post in Berlin as soon as this week, sources said. It couldn\u2019t immediately be confirmed, however, whether Thiel is still in the running.Rumors of Thiel\u2019s candidacy for the cushy job have circulated from Europe to Silicon Valley since the holiday season, even as Thiel has repeatedly denied in interviews that he\u2019s interested in a full-time government position.\u201cNo decisions have been made,\u201d Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told The Post, declining to comment further.A spokesman for Thiel didn\u2019t respond to repeated requests for comment Thursday.Thiel\u2019s talks on the diplomatic post come amid speculation <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/peter-thiel-california-governor-bid-233632\">he might run for governor of California</a>. But one source downplayed the idea, opining that \u201che could never win.\u201d Meanwhile, another said Berlin might be a \u201csteppingstone\u201d toward such an ambition.Chatter that Thiel was \u201clikely\u201d to become German ambassador has rippled through tech and government circles in Berlin in recent weeks, according to a source.\u201cAt first I thought it was silly,\u201d one Silicon Valley insider told The Post. \u201cBut maybe it\u2019s a good way for him to get away, which somebody said he wouldn\u2019t mind doing, given all the negative energy he faced.\u201dThiel got blasted for backing Trump during the election season by the left-leaning tech crowd, which has bristled at, among other things, the president-elect\u2019s threats on immigration.The tone changed last month, however, when titans including Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Google\u2019s Larry Page, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook and Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2016/12/14/trump-pledges-to-play-nice-with-silicon-valley-titans/\">flocked to a summit with the president-elect</a> at Trump Tower that was organized by Thiel.Born in West Germany to German parents before he was brought to the US as a toddler, Thiel also speaks German.Although he has mainly focused on US tech as an investor, Thiel has long warned US tech companies about growing antitrust sentiment in Europe.Earlier this week, Trump <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2017/01/15/trump-merkel-made-catastrophic-mistake-with-refugee-policy/\">ruffled feathers in Germany</a> as he threatened border taxes for German automakers that built cars in Mexico, called NATO \u201cobsolete\u201d and said the EU was just a \u201cvehicle for Germany.\u201dAs talk has surfaced about Thiel\u2019s possible assignment, some insiders have questioned whether it would be high-profile enough for the ambitious Thiel.Others, however, note that Trump has been aggressively cleaning house at US embassies worldwide. Firings of all Obama-appointed ambassadors could portend a broader revamp, sources say.For example, the US\u2019 traditional hierarchy of ambassadorships, placing the UK at the top, with France and Japan traditionally the second- and third-most coveted posts, is in need of an overhaul, many agree.\u201cGermany is running Europe now,\u201d one source noted.On Thursday, Trump <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2017/01/19/trump-taps-nfl-owner-woody-johnson-as-ambassador-to-uk/\">named Jets owner Woody Johnson</a> as UK ambassador.",
    "2017 - 5165": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Mikaila Vigeant came to the inauguration of 45th president of the United States with the hope she might catch a glimpse of him from afar when he took the oath of office Saturday morning.\u201cWe were just about to cross the street, when we heard the sirens,\u201d the 9-year-old said, breaking into a broad smile, \u201cAnd then and he and his motorcade drove past us and I got to wave to him.\u201dDid he wave back? \u201cAbsolutely.\u201dDressed in a bright pink down jacket, Mikaila, whose favorite President so far is Teddy Roosevelt, was with her grandfather Bill Vigeant of Troy, NY, for the historic event.They were at the base of the Capitol on their way to see President-elect Trump at the Lincoln Memorial for the inaugural concert; they saw Trump as he was traveling from a solemn wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia.Washington is filled with school groups, families and busloads of people from all over the country; they were buying souvenirs from street vendors, a choir group was spontaneously singing \u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u201d and families like the Vigeant\u2019s were holding hands and celebrating the peaceful passage of power.They were all either heading to the Memorial for the concert or streaming into congressional offices to pick-up their inaugural tickets for Friday\u2019s big day.Even folks who did not support Trump.Edison Nicholson of Erie, Penn., a 48-year-old program director of the Youth Leadership Institute was one of them, \u201cI did not support Mr. Trump, but I respect the office and the process and as our President I respect him,\u201d he said.\u201cI want him to be successful, we have a moment to move the country forward and I wanted to be part of that, I wanted to respect this and hopefully bring our country together.\u201dNicholson, who is African-American, says people should stop trying to continue the divide and should focus on making him successful, \u201cIt\u2019s like they always say, if he is successful, we all are.\u201dNicholson was joined by 55 other folks from Erie who were at a pizza reception hosted by their congressmen, Republicans G.T. Thompson and Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania.\u201cWe gave out over 400 tickets today,\u201d Kelly said. Earlier, his office was filled with folks from his Western Pennsylvania blue-collar district, comprised of rural farms and former manufacturing towns.\u201cWe could have easily given out double that,\u201d he said, as streams of people poured in looking for maps and dressed in red-white and blue or Pittsburgh Steeler gear, including several \u201cTerrible Towels\u201d the rally towel Steelers fans use to whip up support on and apparently off the field as well.Trump famously twirled the towel last September the day after his first debate at a massive rally in Ambridge, Penn., a suburban Pittsburgh steel town that has seen better days.Mara Cruz Staab, who was born in Panama, stood in Kelly\u2019s officer with her husband Chris Staab near bursting with excitement, \u201cI am so thrilled that he won, to be an American and to be able to have the honor of attending this inauguration. This is the people\u2019s inauguration,\u201d she said.Dressed in elegant black wool suit and gold paisley tie holding the arm of his equally classically dressed wife, Don Navarro and Kim Pichanick were a striking couple as they waited in line for their inaugural tickets.The Dallas couple and business partners walked a mile to get to the line and it did not bother them at all. \u201cFor anyone who is complaining about the traffic, or the inconveniences they need to think about how lucky we are to live in a country like ours, that gives us the freedoms to attend and celebrate or protest or something in between,\u201d he said.Navarro is the son of an illegal immigrant who came here from Mexico in 1927. \u201cMy father was so proud to eventually become an American citizen.\u2018We have a moment to move the country forward and I wanted to be part of that.\u2019He always taught us to never speak Spanish outside of the home, to assimilate with the customs, languages and traditions of the country, and to be proud to be an American,\u201d he said.The 70-year-old and his wife who own a management consulting and business advisory company in Dallas said they loved the great vibe all around the city, \u201cIt really is remarkable, everywhere you went people were happy, you would have thought this was going to be awful with all of the press reports,\u201d Pichanick said.Navarro said he is a Republican on fiscal issues, on the border he wants to see Trump focus on the security, \u201cThat is critical, you will many more Hispanics over like him if he concentrates on keeping us safe,\u201d he said.About 20 minutes into the concert, Trump and his wife Melania walked down the steps of the Lincoln Memorial to the Rolling Stones\u2019 \u201cHeart of Stone.\u201d They then took their seats with the rest of the Trump family.While he sat with his family Trump was clearly enjoying the inaugural concert, smiling, swaying with the music and even singing, despite all of the criticisms ahead of his inaugural celebration, the event was a joyful event.\u201cThis is what is all about, the country, the people, and all we can achieve,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cIt is not about the celebrities, it is about celebration.\u201d",

Together we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come. We will face challenges. We will confront hardships, but we will get the job done,\u201d Trump said.\u201cEvery four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent. Thank you,\u201d he said.He then reiterated his vow to dramatically change the government and the direction of the country.\u201cToday\u2019s ceremony, however, has very special meaning because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington, DC, and giving it back to you, the people,\u201d he said to applause.\u201cFor too long, a small group in our nation\u2019s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered but the jobs left and the factories closed,\u201d Trump continued, blaming the political establishment for the malaise.\u201cTheir triumphs have not been your triumphs and while they celebrated in our nation\u2019s capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land. That all changes starting right here and right now because this moment is your moment.

At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves,\u201d he said.\u201cFor too many of our citizens, a different reality exists. Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities, rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation.\u201dHe decried rising crime in cities across America and repeated his call for a crackdown.\u201cThe crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential. This American carnage stops right here and stops right now. We are one nation and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams, and their success will be our success,\u201d he vowed.Trump also turned combative when touching on his key campaign themes \u2014 jobs, law and order, better trade deals with other countries and infrastructure improvements.\u201cI will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down. America will start winning again. Winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth.

And in your providence have charged us to rule the creatures produced by you, to governing the world in holiness and righteousness, and to render judgment with integrity of heart,\u201d Dolan said.\u201cGive us wisdom for we are your servants, weak and short-lived, lacking in comprehension of judgment and of laws.\u201dNew York Sen.

Whatever our race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, whether we are immigrant or native-born, whether we live with disabilities or do not, in wealth or in poverty, we are all exceptional in our commonly held yet fierce devotion to our country,\u201d he said, as many in the crowd booed and chanted, \u201cWe want Trump\u201d and \u201cLock her up,\u201d referring to Hillary Clinton.\u201cToday we celebrate one of democracy\u2019s core attributes, the peaceful transfer of power.
