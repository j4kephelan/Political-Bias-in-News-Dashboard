Jelena McWilliams, who was appointed to head the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. by President Donald Trump in 2018, said Friday that she <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/12/31/fdic-chair-jelena-mcwilliams-to-resign-526295\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">will cut her five-year term short</a> after an internal power struggle spilled into public view last month.\u201cWhen I immigrated to this country 30 years ago, I did so with a firm belief in the American system of government,\u201d the Yugoslavia-born McWilliams wrote in a resignation letter to President Joe Biden that made no mention of the partisan brawl. \u201cIt has been a tremendous honor to serve this nation, and I did not take a single day for granted.\u201dIn December, McWilliams, the only Trump holdover on the five-member board, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/hostile-takeover-fdic-board-rohit-chopra-michael-hsu-jelena-mcwilliams-abuse-power-11639432939\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">accused her Democratic colleagues</a> of staging a \u201chostile takeover\u201d after they attempted to wrest control of its agenda from her and engineer a vote on changes to the rules governing bank mergers.The shakeup will hand full control of the typically bipartisan board to Democrats, fanning progressives\u2019 hopes for major banking-industry changes. McWilliams, for example, had refused to sign off on a federal report that identified climate change as a threat to the nation\u2019s financial system. McWilliams\u2019 surprise announcement came three weeks after Saule Omarova, Biden\u2019s controversial nominee for the role of comptroller of the currency, was <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/12/07/bidens-bank-regulator-pick-saule-omarova-withdraws-nomination/\">forced to withdraw</a> from consideration after her radical views on the nation\u2019s banking system drew fire from senators of both parties.",
    "2022 - 5779": "The New York City Health Department has conducted its first ever study <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/episrv/indigenous-peoples-health-2021.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">to highlight </a>the conditions of more than 100,000 Native <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2022/01/01/alleged-pretendians-list-exposes-allegedly-fake-native-americans/\">Americans/Indigenous Peoples </a>who live in the five boroughs.The department\u2019s collaboration with the groups representing aboriginal peoples aided city health officials in providing this population with crucial information during the <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2022/01/01/nyc-considering-race-in-distributing-life-saving-covid-treatment/\">coronavirus pandemic</a>, city officials said.\u201cFor the first time in the Health Department\u2019s recorded history, public health information about COVID-19 was released in languages Indigenous to the Americas. Local community leaders provided interpretation in 12 Indigenous languages for virtual community conversations about the COVID-19 vaccines,\u201d the analysis said.The report said that \u201cexisting health, economic and other forms of inequities have converged during the COVID-19 pandemic to increase risk of exposure, infection, and death among Indigenous peoples.\u201dMany of the Native Americans-Indigenous residents migrated from Mexico and other Central and South America countries.The data \u2014 albeit limited for the years 2013-2017 \u2014 reveals that fewer Native Americans obtained a high school degree than the city average; a higher percentage suffered from poverty and unemployment; they used more of their income to cover rent, and fewer had health insurance coverage.Chronic conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes were also more prevalent among Indigenous Peoples than other racial/ethnic groups or the citywide average.A higher percentage of Native Americans also reported heavy drinking of alcohol, consuming sugary drinks or being overweight/obese.\u201cSome health outcomes among Indigenous peoples of the Americas in NYC are comparable to those seen among other communities of color in NYC that have been negatively impacted by structural and institutional racism,\u201d the report said.The city Board of Health recently declared <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/10/18/nyc-board-of-health-declares-racism-a-public-health-crisis/\">structural racism </a>\u2014 including against Indigenous Peoples \u2014 a public health crisis that needs to be addressed.  The Native American-Indigenous population and groups in the city include peoples of Nahua, Mixtec, Garifuna, Quichua, K\u2019iche and Mam and the Red de Pueblos Transnacionales, representing migrants from Mexico.Health officials also consulted with the <a href=\"https://www.aich.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">American Indian Community House,</a> a non-profit organization serving urban Natives since 1969 as part of its research.The analysis said the first Native Americans study \u2014 despite limitations in targeting a small, diverse and in some cases insular population \u2014 is a good step in delving more deeply into the conditions of Indigenous residents and differences among them.\u201cThese findings point to areas of concern and potential intervention related to the health of Indigenous peoples of the Americas living in NYC,\u201d the report said.But officials said current methods used by the Census and the city Health Department undercount Indigenous peoples of the Americas.\u201cAvailable data are limited by several factors. Historic and present-day experiences of cultural and economic oppression, racism, and anti-immigrant and linguistic bias may deter residents from participating in the very surveys meant to ensure they are  represented in order to provide important information to help serve their needs,\u201d the study said.\u201cIn addition,\u201d the report said, \u201cmethods of data collection are steeped in colonialism. The language used to inquire about race (American Indian/Alaska Native) does not reflect the terms that people use for themselves and is perceived as offensive to some. Nor does the current terminology capture the breadth of the group intended to be represented; for example, Mexican, Central, and South Americans of Indigenous origin are often unfamiliar with U.S. racial categories so they may select the `Other\u2019 category\u201d  on the census and other surveys.To address the challenge, the Health Department expanded its questionnaire response on its Community Health Survey from \u201cAmerican Indian/Alaska Native\u201d to \u201cAmerican Indian, Native, First Nations, Indigenous Peoples of the Americas, or Alaska Native\u201d and added a follow-up question of Indigenous residents to identify tribal heritage or ancestry group.\u201cThis is a small but important step to begin to more fully represent New<br/>Yorkers Indigenous to the Americas in our population surveys,\u201d the report says.The city also vastly undercounts deaths of the Native American-Indigenous residents due to inaccurate reporting on death certificates, the study said. The department is working on improving the reporting of deaths of indigenous residents by expanding racial/ethics classifications on death certificates.The study noted there may be several explanations for why more Native Americans-Indigenous Peoples said they lack medical care \u2014 including immigration status or the inability to find practitioners of traditional medicineThe results found 16 percent of Native Americans-Indigenous People said they did not get needed medical care in the prior year, double the 8 percent rate for whites and significantly higher than the city\u2019s overall ten percent average.\u201cWe hope that these data can be a starting point to support Indigenous peoples to further investigate issues of importance to their communities,\u201d the study said.",
