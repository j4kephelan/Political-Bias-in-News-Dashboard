    "2018 - 4786": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Attorney General Jeff Sessions is rescinding the Obama-era policy that had paved the way for legalized marijuana to flourish in states across the country, two people with knowledge of the decision told the Associated Press. Sessions will instead let federal prosecutors where pot is legal decide how aggressively to enforce federal marijuana law, the people said.The people familiar with the plan spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it before an announcement expected Thursday.The move by President Donald Trump\u2019s attorney general likely will add to confusion about whether it\u2019s OK to grow, buy or use marijuana in states where pot is legal, since long-standing federal law prohibits it. It comes days after pot shops opened in California, launching what is expected to become the world\u2019s largest market for legal recreational marijuana and as polls show a solid majority of Americans believe the drug should be legal.While Sessions has been carrying out a Justice Department agenda that follows Trump\u2019s top priorities on such issues as immigration and opioids, the changes to pot policy reflect his own concerns. Trump\u2019s personal views on marijuana remain largely unknown.Sessions, who has assailed marijuana as comparable to heroin and has blamed it for spikes in violence, had been expected to ramp up enforcement. Pot advocates argue that legalizing the drug eliminates the need for a black market and would likely reduce violence, since criminals would no longer control the marijuana trade.The Obama administration in 2013 announced it would not stand in the way of states that legalize marijuana, so long as officials acted to keep it from migrating to places where it remained outlawed and out of the hands of criminal gangs and children. Sessions is rescinding that memo, written by then-Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole, which had cleared up some of the uncertainty about how the federal government would respond as states began allowing sales for recreational and medical purposes.The pot business has since become a sophisticated, multimillion-dollar industry that helps fund schools, educational programs and law enforcement. Eight states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for recreational use, and California\u2019s sales alone are projected to bring in $1 billion annually in tax revenue within several years.Sessions\u2019 policy will let US attorneys across the country decide what kinds of federal resources to devote to marijuana enforcement based on what they see as priorities in their districts, the people familiar with the decision said.Sessions and some law enforcement officials in states such as Colorado blame legalization for a number of problems, including drug traffickers who have taken advantage of lax marijuana laws to hide in plain sight, illegally growing and shipping the drug across state lines, where it can sell for much more. The decision was a win for pot opponents who had been urging Sessions to take action.\u201cThere is no more safe haven with regard to the federal government and marijuana, but it\u2019s also the beginning of the story and not the end,\u201d said Kevin Sabet, president and CEO of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, who was among several anti-marijuana advocates who met with Sessions last month. \u201cThis is a victory. It\u2019s going to dry up a lot of the institutional investment that has gone toward marijuana in the last five years.\u201dThreats of a federal crackdown have united liberals who object to the human costs of a war on pot with conservatives who see it as a states\u2019 rights issue. Some in law enforcement support a tougher approach, but a bipartisan group of senators in March urged Sessions to uphold existing marijuana policy. Others in Congress have been seeking ways to protect and promote legal pot businesses.A task force Sessions convened to study pot policy made no recommendations for upending the legal industry but instead encouraged Justice Department officials to keep reviewing the Obama administration\u2019s more hands-off approach to marijuana enforcement, something Sessions promised to do since he took office.The change also reflects yet another way in which Sessions, who served as a federal prosecutor at the height of the drug war in Mobile, Alabama, has reversed Obama-era criminal justice policies that aimed to ease overcrowding in federal prisons and contributed to a rethinking of how drug criminals were prosecuted and sentenced. While his Democratic predecessor Eric Holder told federal prosecutors to avoid seeking long mandatory minimum sentences when charging certain lower-level drug offenders, for example, Sessions issued an order demanding the opposite, telling them to pursue the most serious charges possible against most suspects.",

    "2018 - 2950": "President Trump on Monday killed special protections for Salvadoran immigrants \u2014 a move that could force nearly 200,000 to leave the US by September 2019 or face deportation.El Salvador is the fourth country whose citizens have lost Temporary Protected Status under Trump, who has taken a hard-line stance on immigration to the US.Salvadorans have been the largest beneficiaries of the program, which provides humanitarian relief for foreigners whose countries are hit with natural disasters or other strife.Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen\u2019s decision, while not surprising, will send shivers through parts of Washington, Los Angeles, New York, Houston and other metropolitan areas that are home to large numbers of Salvadorans.They have enjoyed special protection since earthquakes struck the Central American country in 2001, and many have established deep roots in the US, starting families and businesses.The action also produces a serious challenge for El Salvador, a country of 6.2 million people whose economy banks on money sent by workers in the US.Over the past decade, growing numbers of Salvadorans \u2014 many coming as families or unaccompanied children \u2014 have entered the US illegally through Mexico, fleeing violence and poverty.In September 2016, the Obama administration extended protections for 18 months, saying El Salvador suffered lingering harm from the 2001 earthquakes that killed more than 1,000 people and was temporarily unable to absorb such a large number of returning people.Nielsen, who faced a Monday deadline for a decision, determined that El Salvador had received significant international aid to recover from the earthquake and that homes, schools and hospitals there have been rebuilt.Salvadorans will have until Sept. 9, 2019, to leave the country or adjust their legal status.<br/>\n\u201cThe substantial disruption of living conditions caused by the earthquake\u201d no longer exists, the department said in a statement.Homeland Security also said more than 39,000 Salvadorans have returned home from the US in two years, demonstrating El Salvador\u2019s capacity to absorb people.It said the 18-month delay would give Congress time to develop a legislative change if it chooses, while also giving Salvadorans and their government time to prepare.El Salvador President Salvador Sanchez Ceren spoke by phone Friday with Nielsen to renew his plea to extend status for 190,000 Salvadorans and allow more time for Congress to deliver a long-term fix for them to stay in the U.S.The decision comes amid intensifying talks between the White House and Congress on an immigration package that may include protections for hundreds of thousands of young immigrants who came to the country as children and were temporarily shielded from deportation under an Obama-era program.Trump said in September that he was ending Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, but gave Congress until March to act.<em>With Post Wires</em>",
    "2018 - 3456": "President Trump flew into Tennessee Monday to boast about the red-hot US economy, crediting his tax cuts for fueling the record-shattering stock-market surge.\u201cThe American Dream is roaring back to life.
