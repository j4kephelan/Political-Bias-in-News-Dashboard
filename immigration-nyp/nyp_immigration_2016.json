    "2016 - 7295": "FLORENCE, Italy \u2014 DNA analysis of a condom and cigarette butt led Italian prosecutors to arrest a Senegalese man in <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2016/01/10/american-woman-found-dead-in-italian-apartment/\">the death of an American woman</a> who suffered two fractures to her skull before being strangled in her Florence apartment, they said Thursday.The naked body of Ashley Olsen, 35, of Summer Haven, Florida, was discovered Saturday morning by her boyfriend.Florence chief prosecutor Giuseppe Creazzo told a news conference that investigators <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2016/01/14/suspect-in-killing-of-american-is-brother-to-top-club-promoter/\">had detained Tidiane Cheik Diaw, a 25-year-old Senegalese immigrant</a>, based on witness testimony and DNA analysis, and also because he had Olsen\u2019s cellphone.He said Diaw had offered \u201csubstantially admissive\u201d testimony in response to the accusations during a preliminary interrogation that lasted until 4 a.m. Thursday. Diaw has not yet been charged.Citing witness testimony and street cameras, Creazzo said Olsen and Diaw met for the first time at the Montecarla disco in Florence early Friday and went together to Olsen\u2019s apartment in the Tuscan city\u2019s historic center.He said they had consensual sex. Both <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2016/01/14/italian-police-make-arrest-in-american-womans-kinky-sex-death/\">had drunk alcohol and possibly taken drugs</a> over the course of the night.He said the autopsy determined that Olsen had suffered two fractures to her skull that were so violent, they alone would have killed her. <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2016/01/12/american-woman-was-choked-to-death-with-a-rope-in-florence-autopsy/\">She was subsequently strangled</a>.Police detained Diaw after DNA analysis came back from a used condom and cigarette butt found in Olsen\u2019s bathroom, as well as DNA samples taken from under her fingernails.Diaw was also tied to the crime because he had taken Olsen\u2019s cellphone, put his own SIM card in it and used it, Creazzo said.\u201cWe have gathered serious indications of guilt against him,\u201d Creazzo said, adding, however, that a judge must confirm the arrest.Prosecutors didn\u2019t say if Diaw had a lawyer or had been assigned a court-appointed lawyer.\n<div class=\"inline-slideshow\" data-component=\"inlineSlideshow\">\n<div

    "2016 - 2557": "The Senegalese immigrant who was charged Thursday with murdering an American artist in Florence is the brother of the city\u2019s top club promoter, The Post has learned.DNA that matched Cheik Tidiane Diaw, who came to Italy illegally a few months ago, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2016/01/14/italian-police-ided-suspect-in-killing-of-american-woman/\">was found on a condom and cigarette</a> inside Ashley Olsen\u2019s Florence apartment, Italian prosecutors said at a press conference.They believe <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2016/01/12/american-killed-in-italy-was-last-seen-in-a-seedy-drug-den/\">the two met at a shady, members-only drug den</a> called Montecarla last Thursday night and later went back to her pad to have sex.\u201cThen he probably slammed her head against something, twice fracturing her skull, and then strangled her,\u201d Florence Prosecutor Giuseppe Creazza said Thursday.An American living in Florence for the past decade told The Post that he\u2019s met Diaw several times through his brother, Abraham, who works as the main club promoter in the city.<script async=\"\" defer=\"\" src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script>\u201cHe worked in the clubs, usually in the VIP sections. He would organize the VIP tables for his brother,\u201d the longtime resident said. \u201cHe always was very courteous.\u201dHe\u2019s not sure how the accused murderer wound up at Montecarla, which he described as the \u201cafter-, after-, afterparty\u201d place where scantily dressed women serve coke on platters to patrons.\u201cHis brother, who took care of him, would not allow his brother to do those type of things,\u201d he said.Italian police have surveillance video that shows Diaw leaving 35-year-old Olsen\u2019s apartment and he allegedly confessed to the grisly murder while in police custody, saying that it was an accident, according to NBC News.Creazza also squashed rumors that Olsen was killed in a \u201csex game gone wrong,\u201d which was how many believe British student Meredith Kercher was murdered. Amanda Knox, an American student studying in Perugia at the time, was charged with her death along with her boyfriend. They were both later cleared amid much controversy.Olsen was found naked and lifeless on her bed on Jan. 9 by her boyfriend, Federico Fiorentini.The two had gotten into a fight and he hadn\u2019t heard from her in a few days, so he went to her apartment to check on her. When no one answered, he got the landlord to let him in.Police are still awaiting toxicology results, which they said could take up to two weeks, to determine whether Olsen had any drugs or alcohol in her system.",
    "2016 - 6080": "Donald Trump delivered a one-two punch to Ted Cruz at Thursday night\u2019s GOP debate \u2014 clutching the birther card in one fist while slugging the Texas senator for <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2016/01/13/cruz-slams-trump-for-holding-new-york-values/\">his anti-New York smear</a> with the other.\u201cWho the hell knows if you can even serve in office?\u201d Trump demanded to know of the Canadian-born Cruz during the angriest clash of the campaign between the GOP presidential front-runners.Trump drew boos from the audience at the Fox Business Network-sponsored debate in South Carolina, as he warned that Cruz could be ineligible for the White House, even though his mother is a US citizen.Calling the issue \u201ca big question mark on your head,\u201d Trump declared, \u201cYou can\u2019t do that to the party.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad we\u2019re focusing on the important topics of the evening,\u201d Cruz cracked back, to loud applause.\u201cYou know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had his lawyers look at this from \u00adevery which way, and there was no issue there. There was nothing to this birther issue,\u201d Cruz \u00adresponded.\u201cNow, since September, the Constitution hasn\u2019t changed. But the poll numbers have. And I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa. But the facts and the law here are really quite clear. Under longstanding US law, the child of a US citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen,\u201d he added.Cruz then turned the tables, noting that some birther theories would even disqualify Trump.\u201cSome of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on US soil, but have two parents born on US soil. Interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified, because Donald\u2019s mother was born in Scotland. She was naturalized,\u201d Cruz said to laughter.\u201cOn the issue of citizenship, Donald, I\u2019m not going to use your mother\u2019s birth against you.\u201dTrump suggested that his rival go to court to prove he is a legitimate candidate, prompting more booing from the crowd.Cruz shot back: \u201cI\u2019ve spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the US Supreme Court.

And even the smell of death .\u2009.\u2009. it was with us for months,\u201d Trump said.\u201cWe rebuilt downtown Manhattan and everybody in the world watched, and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.\u201dEven Cruz applauded those words.But he stood silent when Trump added, \u201cAnd I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.\u201d<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"youtube-player\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2o6hrQydyE4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" style=\"border:0;\" title=\"Video\" width=\"640\"></iframe></span>The audience, which had booed Trump earlier, applauded this time.In a previous interview Thursday, with Bloomberg News, Trump warned that <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2016/01/14/trump-defends-new-york-city-after-cruz-attacks/\">Cruz would \u201chave to go through me\u201d</a> if the Texan again attempted to \u00adattack Donald\u2019s hometown.Cruz found himself fending off another attack late in the debate when Marco Rubio portrayed him as a flip-flopper.\u201cYou used to say you were in \u00adfavor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against,\u201d Rubio intoned. \u201cI saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa.

Nikki Haley, who had criticized Trump\u2019s angry rhetoric during her response to President Obama\u2019s State of the Union address on Tuesday \u00adevening.Trump was asked about her comments, but passed up a chance to attack the popular governor in her home state and said he wasn\u2019t offended that she called him angry.<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"youtube-player\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K74H0ab5-5M?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" style=\"border:0;\" title=\"Video\" width=\"640\"></iframe></span>",
    "2016 - 10921": "<em>Starting in the late 1960s, the United States suffered the biggest sustained rise in violent crime in its history \u2014 because of the demographic bump of the baby boom, an increase in drug use and trafficking and the softening of judges and prosecutors. Barry Latzer, an emeritus professor of criminal justice at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, CUNY, tracks what happened in his new book, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Rise-Fall-Violent-Crime-America/dp/159403835X?tag=nypost-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://nypost.com/2016/01/17/how-fear-of-cocaine-leading-to-death-or-jail-led-to-significant-crime-decline/&amp;asc_source=web\">The Rise and Fall of Violent Crime in America</a>.\u201d In this excerpt, Latzer explains how and why the tide finally turned in the late 1990s.</em>America woke from its crime nightmare during the last decade of the 20th century. The cocaine war was over, muggings were on the wane and cities were becoming as safe as they had been before the long ordeal began in the late 1960s.For those in the business of analyzing crime, the great downturn of the 1990s was a lesson in humility. None of the usual suspects seemed to account for the good news.\u201cPoor black urban areas, where cocaine gangs once flourished, became the scenes of some of the biggest declines in crime.\u201dWhile the economic data of the 1990s were extremely positive, and African-American conditions in particular improved greatly, there were givebacks in the new century. And when the economy tanked altogether after 2007, crime continued to fall. The new immigration, on balance, was also a wash. Hispanic immigrants probably caused more crime than not, and Asian and Eastern European entrants were too few in number and too dispersed to significantly reduce crime rates in the vastness of the United States.One of the few things that is unquestionably true is that the baby-boom generation \u2014 the \u201cwild bunch\u201d responsible for the massive escalation of violence that began in the late 1960s \u2014 began to age out of crime in the 1980s.Someone born in the peak childbirth year, 1947, would have been 33 in 1980, which is close to retirement age for violent criminals.But note that there\u2019s a huge homicide bulge centered around the early 1990s, as armed youth drug gangs single-handedly drove the killing rates to unprecedented peaks. This younger cohort\u2019s turn to less lethal behaviors in the second half of the decade needs explaining, and that change, of course, cannot be attributed to the aging of the boomers.Why, then, did the new post-1960s generation \u2014 the cohort born in the 1970s \u2014 become less violent after the mid-1990s?Two interrelated factors were crucial in the great turn from violent crime by the 1970s cohorts. First, the cocaine epidemic ran its course, taking down with it all of the associated crimes of violence. Second, a revivified criminal-justice system \u2014 more aggressive policing and increased imprisonment of offenders \u2014 removed from circulation some of the most dangerous criminals.Abandonment of cocaine by the age cohort born after 1970 is measurable. US Justice Department funding enabled researchers to track changes in offender drug use.Investigators interviewed and sampled the urine of over 13,000 persons arrested in Manhattan between 1987 and 1997, from roughly the onset to the decline of the crack epidemic. Analysts were able to determine the proportion of offenders who were using drugs and, just as significant, the types of drugs they used and the ages of the users.The heroin injectors, it turns out, were baby boomers, born between 1945 and 1954. Arrestees born between 1955 and 1969, as samples showed, had turned to crack cocaine.But among arrestees born in the 1970s \u2014 the same cohort that had driven up murder rates in the late 1980s and early 1990s \u2014 crack cocaine use fell off dramatically. Nearly half of those born before 1969 reported the use of cocaine; for those born in 1972, the figure plummeted to 20%.What\u2019s more, the rejection of crack stuck with subsequent adolescent cohorts. Test subjects born in 1979, who would have reached their prime years for violence in the second half of the 1990s, had less than a 5% usage rate.Ethnographic research confirmed the sharp curtailment of cocaine use. Richard Curtis spent 10 years, from 1987 to 1997, conducting fieldwork in several Hispanic neighborhoods in Brooklyn.He noted firsthand the devastation wrought by drugs, followed in the mid-1990s by what he called \u201can improbable transformation\u201d motivated by fear of drugs and their consequences.The extraordinarily negative effects of crack use \u2014 addiction, ill health, incarceration and the loss of virtually all socially acceptable opportunities for self-advancement \u2014 were always present and perhaps always understood by users. But as with other risky behaviors indulged by youth, the negatives simply were ignored. So vulnerable were they to peer influences that death itself didn\u2019t seem to matter to these young \u201ccrackheads.\u201dOnce crack became unacceptable to peers, however, once the whole crack subculture became socially disreputable on the streets, it was abandoned just as quickly as it had been adopted.As soon as crack fell out of favor, robbery to support habits, killing to protect distribution operations and a plethora of violent and nonviolent offenses associated with its use also petered out.Just as teen faddism rapidly established the crack craze in the first place, the same contagion effect helped ensure its decline.The results (as Curtis\u2019 Brooklyn study recounted) were transformative. Neighborhoods that had been cocaine war zones, scarcely fit for law-abiding residents, saw massive declines in violence.Poor black urban areas, where cocaine gangs once flourished, became the scenes of some of the biggest declines in crime.In five New York City police precincts with populations that were over 80% black and suffered from high poverty, including Harlem and Brooklyn\u2019s Bedford-Stuyvesant, the murder rate dropped a remarkable 78% in the 1990s, even outdoing the citywide rate decline by 5%.These precincts had had staggering homicide rates in 1990: from two to four times the rate for the city overall.The second crucial reason for the diminution of crime by the 1970s cohort was the reconstitution of the criminal-justice system.When crime first shot up in the late 1960s, the system was overwhelmed. The number of arrests per reported crime went down, not up; sentencing to prison occurred less often, not more; and prison time served for serious crimes actually shortened, not lengthened.By the 1980s, however, most of the flabbiness in the system had been, or soon would be, reversed. Although police clearance rates did not improve (indeed, they stayed level or declined), the size of police forces grew and, perhaps more important, law enforcement adopted smarter tactics.\u201cThe pressures of police harassment, arrests and high rates of imprisonment, combined with the consequences of the whole grim cocaine lifestyle, set off an anticrack craze \u2014 a positive contagion \u2014 and by the mid-1990s, the short-term spike was over.\u201dSome of the new practices \u2014 CompStat and hot-spots policing, most notably \u2014 seem to have been effective.A more recent study of crime in the Big Apple concurs. The NYPD, wrote Franklin Zimring, \u201cplaced successful emphasis on suppressing public open air drug markets. The first drug priority for policing was driving drug trade from public to private space. For a variety of reasons, this also may have reduced the risk of conflict and violence associated with contests over drug turf.\u201dIn other words, police antidrug tactics worked not only to drive down the public drug trade \u2014 a great good in itself \u2014 but also to bring down the killing and other violence associated with it, a wonderful collateral benefit.Incarceration for drug crimes, which, strictly speaking, are not considered crimes of violence, nevertheless contributed to the decline in violent crime, given the propensity of the cocaine offenders to engage in violence.All told, the revitalized criminal justice system was a big gun in the crime-reduction arsenal, but its implementation was not without costs. Exceptionally high minority incarceration rates and collateral restrictions on prisoners once released, as well as huge taxpayer expenses for building and maintaining prisons and increasing the size of police departments and other justice system agencies, contributed to the high price paid for the great lockdown.But if one were to compare the toll of the enormous crime rates of the pre-1995 period \u2014 the killings, maimings and property losses of crime victims; the negative impact on urban economies; the fear and dread, especially in big cities and in minority communities; to say nothing of the devastation of the cocaine generation \u2014 it is very unlikely that the cost of the reinvigorated system of justice would outweigh the terrible price of failing to act aggressively.<a class=\"alignright\" href=\"https://vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/01/41lsf-oalbl-_sx331_bo1204203200_.jpg?quality=100&amp;strip=all\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-10026210\" height=\"345\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px\" src=\"https://vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/01/41lsf-oalbl-_sx331_bo1204203200_.jpg?quality=100&amp;strip=all&amp;w=200\" srcset=\"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/01/41lsf-oalbl-_sx331_bo1204203200_.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=230 230w, https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/01/41lsf-oalbl-_sx331_bo1204203200_.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=115 115w, https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/01/41lsf-oalbl-_sx331_bo1204203200_.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all 333w\" width=\"230\"/></a>To summarize, the retirement from crime of the baby-boom generation was the main reason for the end of the post-1960s crime tsunami. The boomers had driven violent crime to record heights in their day, but by the 1980s, their day had passed.Their children, prey to the lure of cocaine, launched a short-term crime wave of their own. But in the face of this latest escalation, the retrenched criminal justice system responded aggressively instead of caving in as it had in the late 1960s and early \u201970s.The pressures of police harassment, arrests and high rates of imprisonment, combined with the consequences of the whole grim cocaine lifestyle, set off an anticrack craze \u2014 a positive contagion \u2014 and by the mid-1990s, the short-term spike was over.The great crime tidal wave was finally receding.<em>Excerpted from \u201c<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Rise-Fall-Violent-Crime-America/dp/159403835X?tag=nypost-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://nypost.com/2016/01/17/how-fear-of-cocaine-leading-to-death-or-jail-led-to-significant-crime-decline/&amp;asc_source=web\">The Rise and Fall of Violent Crime in America</a>\u201d by Barry Latzer, out this week from Encounter Books.</em>",
    "2016 - 2383": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Illegal immigrants who haven\u2019t committed major crimes should be allowed to stay in United States, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said Sunday.\u201cIf you\u2019re a criminal alien, no, you can\u2019t stay. If you\u2019re someone that hasn\u2019t been here for a very long time, you can\u2019t stay,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press\">Rubio said on Meet the Press</a>. \u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to round up and deport 12 million people.\u201dThose committing lesser crimes could stay, according to Rubio, who was short on the specifics of any plan.Rubio\u2019s stance on immigration has been in flux since he backed away from Sen. Chuck Schumer and the so-called Gang of Eight plan that proposed comprehensive immigration reform and a pathway to citizenship.The GOP contender said Sunday border and visa security must a priority before any legalization.\u201cIt is very clear now more than ever that we are not going to be able to do anything on people that are illegally until we first prove to people that illegal immigration is under control and America is safe,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cAnd ISIS poses a very unique threat unlike anything we have faced in the past. This group has shown a capability of inserting people in foreign countries using the immigration system.\u201dGOP front-runner Donald Trump has risen in the polls with his talk of a \u201cdeportation force\u201d to send back an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants.Trump has compared this plan to the efforts of President Dwight Eisenhower to remove immigrants in the 1950s in effort dubbed \u201cOperation Wetback.\u201dPressed on whether that effort was shameful chapter in American history, Trump Sunday defended his stance.\u201cWell some people do,\u201d Trump told CNN, \u201cand some people think it was a very effective chapter and what happened was when they removed some, meaning brought them back, when they brought them back, they removed some everybody else left. And it was very successful everyone said. So I mean that\u2019s the way it is. Look, we either have a country, or we don\u2019t. If we don\u2019t have strong borders we have a problem.\u201dTrump has been hounding rival Sen. Ted Cruz for being born in Canada and questioning whether he would be eligible to be president. Asked Sunday if Rubio has the same \u201ccloud\u201d as being a child of immigrants, Trump said no.\u201cNo, it\u2019s a different, very different thing because he was born here he was born on the land,\u201d Trump concluded.",
