    "2019 - 4743": "BANGKOK \u2014 Australia\u2019s government said Wednesday it will assess the resettlement case of a Saudi woman who fled from her family now that <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/01/07/saudi-teen-who-escaped-abusive-parents-wont-be-immediately-deported/\">the United Nations has deemed her a refugee</a>, taking the woman\u2019s high-profile quest for asylum a step forward.The Department of Home Affairs confirmed in a statement that the UN High Commissioner for Refugees had referred 18-year-old Rahaf Mohammed Al-Qunun to Australia for consideration for refugee resettlement.Al-Qunun arrived in Bangkok on a flight from Kuwait on Saturday, and planned to continue to Australia, where she held a tourist visa. But after being detained by Thai authorities, she refused to board a flight back to Kuwait, barricading herself in an airport hotel room.After grabbing worldwide attention with dramatic posts on social media in which she said she <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/01/06/saudi-teen-fears-shell-be-killed-if-sent-back-home/\">feared for her safety if made to return home to her family</a>, Al-Qunun eventually was placed in the care of the UNHCR as her bid for refugee status was considered.Australia\u2019s Home Affairs Department said it would \u201cconsider this referral in the usual way, as it does with all UNHCR referrals.\u201dIndications from Canberra suggest Al-Qunun may receive a sympathetic hearing.\u201cIf she is found to be a refugee, then we will give very, very, very serious consideration to a humanitarian visa,\u201d Health Minister Greg Hunt told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. before the UNHCR\u2019s referral.The case has highlighted the cause of women\u2019s rights in Saudi Arabia. Several female Saudis fleeing abuse by their families have been caught trying to seek asylum abroad in recent years and returned home. Human rights activists say many more similar cases will have gone unreported.The influence of the internet on Al-Qunun\u2019s case was noted by several human rights advocates.The representative in Australia of Human Rights Watch, Elaine Pearson, said it was encouraging that Al-Qunun was able to highlight her situation using social media, and she hoped more Saudi women might act similarly.\u201cThe unique thing about this case is that she had access to social media, and was able to report on it and bring the world\u2019s attention to her plight,\u201d said Pearson. \u201cI think there are many cases like this that go unreported.\u201dA similar point was made by UNHCR spokesman Babar Baloch, who said that what was different in Al-Qunun\u2019s case was that \u201cthe wave of all of the voices of solidarity and support came together, joined up in terms of caring for this individual.\u201dThailand\u2019s immigration police chief Lt. Gen. Surachate Hakparn said that Al-Qunun\u2019s father and brother arrived together in Bangkok on Tuesday but Al-Qunun refused to meet them.Surachate discussed her case on Tuesday with the Saudi charge d\u2019affaires in Thailand, Abdalelah Mohammed A. Alsheaiby. In a video clip of the meeting released by Thai immigration police, Alsheaiby is heard telling Thai officials: \u201cFrom the moment she arrived, she opened a new account and her followers reached almost 45,000 in a day. And I would have preferred it better if her phone was taken instead of her passport.\u201dThe comments sparked anger on social media. Surachate said police could not confiscate her phone because she was not being detained, and said the Saudi diplomat\u2019s remark was \u201cjust an opinion\u201d and \u201cnothing to be taken seriously.\u201dA Tuesday statement from the Saudi embassy in Thailand denied interfering in Al-Qunun\u2019s case, and said it was only monitoring her situation. Describing her case as a \u201cfamily affair,\u201d it said Saudi officials had neither seized her passport \u2014 as Al-Qunun had claimed several times \u2014 nor demanded her deportation home.The embassy and Thai officials earlier said that Al-Qunun was stopped by Thai authorities because she did not have a return ticket, a hotel reservation or itinerary to show she was a tourist, which appeared to have raised a red flag about the reasons for her trip.Saudi Arabia\u2019s wider human rights record has come under intense scrutiny since the killing of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi in October. Khashoggi, who wrote critically of Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman in columns for the Washington Post, had been living in self-imposed exile before Saudi agents <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/10/19/saudis-confirm-killing-of-jamal-khashoggi-several-nationalists-detained/\">killed and dismembered him inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul</a>.The kingdom offered various shifting accounts of the circumstances of his death before eventually settling on the explanation that he died in a botched operation to forcibly bring him back to Saudi Arabia."
