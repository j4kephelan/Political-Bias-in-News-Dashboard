    "2011 - 2726": "<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-11/republicans-hug-big-government-in-abortion-fight-ann-woolner.html\">Ann Woolner has a column accusing\u00a0Republicans for their supposed hypocrisy about abortion</a>. Woolner claims that two current bills by Republican House members, which have to do with limiting government funding of abortion and curtailing abortions being paid for in the future ObamaCare exchanges are turning Republican principles of limiting government intrusion in personal decision-making and are antithetical to sound conservative fiscal principles. The fact that she is confusing Republicans who are more libertarian with Republicans who are more conservative is beside the point. She wants more honesty about the legislators true intentions. \u201cThe Smith bill\u2019s true aim isn\u2019t to prevent taxpayer funding but to take the movement closer to its ultimate goal of ending all abortion. Anti-abortion forces can\u2019t do that outright because it would be unconstitutional and has been since 1973. But ever since the U.S. Supreme Court so ruled in Roe v. Wade, opponents have been passing state and federal laws to throw as many barriers between women and abortion as courts will allow, while pushing Republican presidents to name judges who will permit more hurdles\u201d Woolner complains. OK, you want honesty Ann, let\u2019s be honest.\u00a0Yes, there are legislators whose priority\u00a0is to limit abortions in any legal, constitutional way they can. And yes, some of\u00a0these legislators will prioritize their moral objections to abortion over and above their fiscal philosophy.\u00a0Now can we have a little honesty from your side? Ann, where is your admission that \u201cPro-Choice\u201d professionals will prioritize any effort to increase access to abortion and make abortions as cheap as possible? And <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E1cHVV4NDc\">where,\u00a0oh where, is your outrage at the butcher of Philadelphia who was snipping live-babies\u2019 spines</a>?\u00a0How about a column <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-01-30-abortion-clinics-oversight_N.htm\">urging greater government oversight and intervention at\u00a0abortion clinics where there seems to be little to none</a>?\u00a0Or <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/08/us-abortion-video-idUSTRE7173U220110208\">how about the tales of Planned Parenthood employees who are aiding and betting sex trafficking and\u00a0abortions for underage prostitutes</a>? \u00a0\u00a0The point is that those who oppose abortion oppose it seriously just as those who support the right to it support that right seriously. These extreme position, the sensational video\u00a0highjacks the debate and silences the vast middle who want what Bill Clinton said he wanted, abortions that were safe, legal and rare. ",

    "2011 - 511": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The US House of Representatives voted Friday to block funding for reproductive services provider Planned Parenthood.The 240-185 vote on the amendment offered by Indiana Republican Rep. Mike Pence to strip Planned Parenthood of federal dollars was part of an overarching bill that will fund the federal government through September.Heated debate on the amendment took a surprising turn late Thursday when Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) told her colleagues on the House floor that she had an abortion.",
    "2011 - 2584": "The House of Representatives reading the Constitution aloud may have seemed like a one-off, but maybe not. Instead it is starting to look like the 2012 elections will not only decide whether President Obama gets another term but where Americans stand on the question of federalism. In the coming days and months\u00a0citizens might do well to ask themselves where they stand on the\u00a0spectrum of states rights vs federal government rights. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/21/AR2011022104351.html?hpid=topnews\">Take the case of Carol Anne Bond to be heard by the Supreme Court next week.</a> Bond tried to kill her best friend using chemicals she puurchased over the Internet and\u00a0stolen from her workplace. She failed in her attempts but \u201c[p]rosecutors sent Bond to prison under the anti-terrorist statutes meant to enforce an international chemical-weapons treaty.\u201d The Supreme Court will hear Bond\u2019s case to decide whether her claim that the feds exceeded their power by prosecuting her case is correct or whether the government\u2019s argument, that Bond doesn\u2019t have standing because only states can make such a case, not individuals, is the correct one. The Bond case may have broader implications because a ruling in her favor will bolster the claims made by state attorneys general against ObamaCare that the health reform law\u2019s individual mandate oversteps the federal government\u2019s power to regulate. The crux of the case is whether the Congress has the power it claims or whether the states and only the states have such a right. <a href=\"http://conhomeusa.typepad.com/video/2011/02/we-dont-need-the-federal-government-imposing-a-one-size-fits-all-plan-on-america-mitt-romney-discuss.html\">By the way, the federalist case is how Mitt Romney is trying to get himself out of the health care bind he\u2019s in.</a> He is against ObamaCare but he enacted OBamaCare in Massachusetts? Romney told George Stephanopolous that ealth care reform is up to individual states to solve and what worked in Massachusetts (even though it isn\u2019t working) might not fit another state. Romney kept repeating this mantra that it should be up o the states to decide and used the same formulation when asked about abortion. Finally we have the Gov. of Wisconsim Scott Walker basically telling the <a href=\"http://krmg.com/blogs/the_krmg_morning_news_blog/2011/02/video-abcs-karl-obama-denounce.html\">President of the United States to buzz off when it comes to his opinions about unions and how to balance a budget.</a> This is my state\u2019s problem, Walker basically said to Obama.
