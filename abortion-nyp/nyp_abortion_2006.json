    "2006 - 1448": " ALBANY \u2013 Republican Senate hopeful Jeanine Pirro refused yesterday to back President Bush\u2019s selection of Samuel Alito for the Supreme Court, in part because of Alito\u2019s past anti-abortion views.   The refusal by Pirro, who backs abortion rights, drew a quick condemnation from state Conservative Party leader Mike Long, whose support Pirro has been aggressively seeking.   \u201cI\u2019m assuming Jeanine supported Bush for president and, therefore, she should be out front supporting the president\u2019s nominee for the Supreme Court \u2013 because we know Hillary Clinton is going to vote \u2018no,\u2019 \u201d Long told The Post.   \u201cUp and down New York, Conservatives backed George Bush for the exact reason of having someone like Judge Alito appointed to the Supreme Court,\u201d Long said.   Pirro, the Westchester district attorney, wants to \u201cwait and see the Senate confirmation hearings\u201d before making up her mind on Alito, said spokeswoman Andrea Tantaros.   \u201cShe wants to hear the tough questions and she wants to hear the answers on a wide spectrum of issues,\u201d Tantaros said.   Tantaros said Alito\u2019s views on abortion and the law would be a key factor in helping Pirro decide whether to back him, although she added, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a deal-breaker.\u201d   Ex-Yonkers Mayor John Spencer, an anti-abortion Republican who is challenging Pirro for the GOP and Conservative lines, said he strongly backed Alito and accused Pirro of trying to \u201cperpetrate a fraud\u201d on the parties.

    "2006 - 1158": " WASHINGTON \u2013 Sen. Charles Schumer led a trio of Democrats yesterday railing against Supreme Court pick Samuel Alito for his past pro-life views, and threatened a bruising confirmation battle.   \u201cAnyone who thinks that this nomination is a foregone conclusion is sadly mistaken,\u201d said Schumer, a member of the Judiciary Committee.   \u201cThere are too many questions still to be answered, too many doubts still to be alleviated, to say that this nomination is a slam dunk,\u201d Schumer said while throwing down the gauntlet for a nominee whose hearings won\u2019t even begin until January.   Schumer, joined on the Senate floor by Minority Leader Harry Reid (Nev.) and Sen. Edward Kennedy (Mass.), lambasted Alito as a right-wing zealot for writing in a 1985 job application that the Constitution \u201cdoes not protect a right to an abortion.\u201d   \u201cIt\u2019s clear Judge Alito is not the only one who has been skeptical of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Roe v. Wade,\u201d fired back Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), referring to the 1973 pro-abortion ruling.   Republicans rushed to Alito\u2019s defense.   \u201cI\u2019m excited about defending and supporting this nominee,\u201d said Sen. Jim DeMint (S.C.). ",

    "2006 - 798": " WASHINGTON \u2013 Sen.

Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and other Dem leaders took shots at Alito for that statement.

    "2006 - 7360": " LITITZ, Pa. \u2013 The 14-year-old girl whose unhinged 18-year-old boyfriend gunned down her parents in a fight over their illicit affair stood dazed as she laid her folks to rest yesterday.   Wearing a white sweater and long black skirt, Kara Beth Borden smiled and hugged the nearly 400 friends and relatives attending the funeral service in rural Lancaster County for both her parents. They were brutally slain last Sunday, allegedly by her boyfriend, David Ludwig.   \u201cShe\u2019s been dealing with this situation for a few days,\u201d her lawyer, Robert Breyer, said. \u201cShe\u2019s absolutely in shock about what has happened.\u201d   The service came as an alarming picture emerged of the downward spiral Ludwig was traveling as he carried on the affair with his underage girlfriend. The two got together in a deeply religious community and against the wishes of her devoutly Christian family.   Also yesterday, police revealed that Ludwig had once before abducted a girl. Sometime in the spring, police said, he took a girl to his family\u2019s hunting cabin in Juniata County, but brought her back voluntarily. The situation was resolved between Ludwig\u2019s family and the girl\u2019s family, police said.   It was also revealed that Ludwig had an obsession with guns and was videotaped discussing in detail carrying out a brutal murder.   Ludwig is charged with gunning down Borden\u2019s parents \u2013 Michael and Cathryn \u2013 at their home, then going on the run with his girlfriend before police caught up with them in Indiana.   As the media swarmed the small town, friends recalled how the five-month fling was perhaps the worst-kept secret in town but was tragically misjudged as mere teenage rebellion.   In the eyes of those in this idyllic community in central Pennsylvania, the teen lovers were raised to be wholesome and God-fearing, yet thumbed their noses at family, friends, convention and the law.   Friends and neighbors either missed \u2013 or dismissed \u2013 the hints of something darker and deadlier.   \u201cI knew he was sneaking into her house in the middle of the night,\u201d Ludwig\u2019s friend Zach Horvath told the Lancaster New Era newspaper. \u201cPeople were getting pretty upset about it.\u201d   Deeply religious and heavily involved in the local church, Michael Borden was remembered at yesterday\u2019s funeral for giving his younger daughter, Katelyn, a diamond ring for promising to remain chaste until marriage.   \u201cHe would do everything he could to keep her pure until she married,\u201d said the Rev. Rex Trogden at the service.   So the pair \u2013 who were both home-schooled \u2013 tried to keep their budding love a secret. Ludwig often sneaked in and out of her house, and the two of them e-mailed nude pictures of themselves to each other.   But fights with the Bordens over the relationship occurred frequently, and it was during one such fight that Ludwig shot and killed them, cops said.   But his lawyers, James Gratton and Merrill Spahn, say he may not have acted alone, and indicated that Borden may have been involved.   \u201cWe have been advised by Mr. Ludwig that the behavior of [Kara] and himself [while on the run] . . . will serve to negate the charge of kidnapping . . . and will be directly relevant to the issue of the involvement of the parties in the charges of homicide,\u201d they wrote in a motion filed on Friday.   Borden\u2019s attorney said any thought that she could have been behind the murder of her own parents was ridiculous.   \u201cIf the cops thought she had anything to do with this, she wouldn\u2019t be at home watching movies, she would be held in detention,\u201d Breyer said.   As the relationship went on, there were changes in the pair, friends recall.   \u201cDavid was slipping in the last couple of months, drawing back from everyone and putting on a facade,\u201d Horvath said. \u201cNobody really knew the real David anymore.\u201d   Horvath said friends told him of a particularly startling conversation with Ludwig that took place a day and a half before the murders.   \u201cHe had been making comments, \u2018Oh, I could kill someone and get away with it, disappear and nobody would find me,\u2019 \u201d Horvath said.   The chilling claim was a long way from the friendly, outgoing Christian boy known to many here. Cristen Frederick, a 23-year-old college student who worked with Ludwig at Circuit City, said she knew Ludwig and Borden were dating \u2013 and keeping it secret because of the age gap.   \u201cHe was a really good guy,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was friendly and joked around. I considered him to be a good Christian. He brought his Bible and read it during breaks.\u201d   Borden, on the other hand, frequently brushed off friends\u2019 warnings that Ludwig could end up in jail for dating her.   But cops say the situation was clearing growing more sinister right beneath everyone\u2019s noses.   In an alarming video file retrieved from Ludwig\u2019s computer, cops say he and a pal, Samuel Lohr, 19, ran through detailed scenarios to conduct an armed raid on another family\u2019s home and kill people inside.   Police said Lohr told them that the aborted break-in featured in the 18-minute video was among several such \u201clate-night armed plans of forcible entry\u201d that he and Ludwig conducted.   In the video, the pair are shown taking guns from Ludwig\u2019s house to a home and discussing using them to \u201cshoot and kill family members inside of the residence,\u201d according to an affidavit.   The movie showed Ludwig and Lohr talking about \u201cLudwig\u2019s intimate relationship with Kara Borden before deciding to continue their \u2018night patrol\u2019 \u201d by going to the Borden home, the affidavit said.   They also discussed having sex with Kara and her 13-year-old sister but noted \u201cthat the sex would constitute statutory rape,\u201d and Ludwig said he might have to kill someone if anyone found out about it, the affidavit said.   Police seized 54 guns from the home where Ludwig lived with his parents, according to court documents. Ludwig is being held without bail on murder and kidnapping; Borden has not been charged.   \u201cLiving inside the devastation of this unimaginably horrible week, no words can adequately express the sorrow, shock and senselessness of what we\u2019re all experiencing,\u201d the Ludwig family said in a statement, declining further comment.   The Ludwigs had lived in the area for about eight years, the Bordens for nine.   Michael Borden worked in printing; Ludwig\u2019s father was an airline pilot and an avid gun collector.   The Bordens \u2013 including Kara, two older brothers, a younger brother and a younger sister \u2013 lived comfortably in a home worth about $300,000.   The Ludwigs bred dogs and encouraged sports and outdoor activities for their children.   Ludwig also was part of a community band, playing sax. Borden liked dogs and prayer and played on the youth soccer team.   Tiffany Bomberger, 21, a graduate of the home-school group, knew and liked the pair.   \u201cWe were close. We hung out a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cWe would talk and do different things together. I thought he was a great guy. He was smart, friendly and very talented. And he had a high IQ.\u201d   The teens would go snowboarding, and Ludwig mastered the sport in a matter of hours.   Yet in the last five months, they hadn\u2019t talked as much, Bomberger said. She thought it was because he\u2019d gotten the job at Circuit City and was trying to be a volunteer EMT.   He was more introverted lately, she said. \u201cBut I took that like a lot of teenagers go through things like that.\u201d  erin.calabrese@nypost.com",

    "2006 - 2152": "THE hot-button topics of abortion and homosexual marriage will likely be among the few defining issues between Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and Nassau County Executive Tom Suozzi if Suozzi challenges Spitzer for governor, Democratic strategists agree.   Spitzer, who is Jewish, has repeatedly endorsed gay marriages and, while he told The Post he doesn\u2019t plan to sponsor such a measure, he said he\u2019ll sign a gay-marriage bill into law if it is sent to him by the Legislature.   Spitzer also strongly favors abortion rights and is against a ban on late-term, or \u201cpartial birth,\u201d abortions.   Suozzi, who is Roman Catholic, opposes gay marriages and backs a ban on late-term abortions.   Spitzer is expected to have considerable appeal to the Democrats\u2019 most liberal, Manhattan-oriented, voters, while Suozzi is expected to appeal to more traditional, outer-borough and suburban Democrats.   Most party leaders doubt that Suozzi, who is expected to announce next month that he\u2019ll enter the Democratic primary for governor, can defeat the popular Spitzer.   \u201cI think Spitzer wins easily,\u201d said Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver of Manhattan, the first leading Democrat to endorse Spitzer for governor.   \u201cHe protected pensioners, small investors, people in the insurance industry, and people know it and aren\u2019t going to forget it.\u201d   *   Top state Republican leaders gather for what is expected to be a somber, post-election meeting today, but earlier plans to endorse candidates for governor and U.S. senator apparently have been shelved.   State GOP Chairman Stephen Minarik said he\u2019s now seeking \u201ca sense of direction\u201d from the party\u2019s regional vice chairmen, many of whom are still shocked by a series of Election Day losses.   Minarik, who backs former Mass. Gov. William Weld and outgoing Westchester DA Jeanine Pirro as his party\u2019s candidates for governor and senator, said he would wait until next month\u2019s gathering of 62 county GOP chairmen from throughout the state before pushing ahead for a formal endorsement.
