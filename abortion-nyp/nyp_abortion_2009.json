    "2009 - 2177": "  An air-charter company favored by a slew of A-list celebs recklessly overfilled its jets with cut-rate fuel \u2013 a penny-pinching measure that caused one plane to abort takeoff at Teterboro Airport and skid into rush-hour traffic, authorities said yesterday.   Six employees of the now-defunct Platinum Jet Management \u2013 which counted Beyonc\u00e9, Snoop Dogg, Jay-Z and Harvey Weinstein as clients, according to ABC News \u2013 have been arrested for their alleged roles in the February 2005 crash.   Twenty people were injured, four seriously, but all survived.   The jet, which ABC reports may have also served former Presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush, attempted to take off with 1,000 pounds more fuel than was reported in flight paperwork, feds in Newark said.   The Canadair Challenger CL-600 aborted takeoff at Teterboro, skidded across Route 46 and smashed into a brick warehouse.   Like motorists cruising for cheap gas, Platinum\u2019s bosses frequently topped up their planes\u2019 tanks at airports that had good fuel deals, said an indictment unsealed in Newark federal court.   But filling a jet\u2019s tank to the brim isn\u2019t the same as filling up a car \u2013 and the weight can offset a plane\u2019s balance.   The fuel on the doomed plane was also loaded further forward in the plane than its pilots realized, investigators said.   \u201cIt is astounding \u2013 and criminal \u2013 that owners and operators of jet aircraft would repeatedly engage in such a dangerous game with passengers and airplanes loaded to the brim with jet fuel,\u201d said Ralph Marra, the acting US attorney in New Jersey.   Platinum is also accused of operating a charter service without proper FAA certificates and using unqualified pilots.   Four suspects were arrested yesterday in Florida \u2013 Michael Brassington, 35, the president and CEO of Platinum Jet Management; his brother Paul, 29, a company vice-president; and company officials Andre Budhan, 42, and Brien McKenzie, 42. They are being held without bail pending a hearing Monday.   Two other suspects were being sought.   Neither of the pilots in the Teterboro crash flight was charged.<em><a href=\"mailto:bill.sanderson@nypost.com\">bill.sanderson@nypost.com</a></em>",
    "2009 - 3194": "  Fla. doctor loses license after botched abortion  TAMPA, Fla. (AP) \u2013 The Board of Medicine has revoked the license of a Florida doctor accused of medical malpractice in a botched abortion case in which a live baby was delivered, but ended up dead in a cardboard box.   The board on Friday found Dr. Pierre Jean-Jacque Renelique in violation of Florida statutes by committing medical malpractice, delegating responsibility to unlicensed personnel, and failing to keep an accurate medical record. Renelique and his attorney declined to comment after the hearing.   The Department of Health said Renelique was scheduled to perform an abortion on a teenager who was 23 weeks pregnant in 2006. Sycloria Williams had been given drugs in advance to dilate her cervix.   According to the complaint, she gave birth at a Hialeah clinic after waiting hours for Renelique to arrive. The complaint said one of the clinic owners put the baby in a bag that was thrown away.   Police found the infant\u2019s decomposing remains a week later.   A medical examiner determined the cause of death was extreme prematurity, the complaint states.   At Friday\u2019s hearing, Renelique told the board of his life-long quest to be a doctor. He said there are generations of physicians in his family, and that he decided to follow the same path after seeing his father treat patients.   Renelique described saving a woman\u2019s life during the second year of his medical residency in Haiti. He later left his home country to work and train in the United States. It was never his intention to do abortions, he said.   \u201cThat was not part of my goals when I came to Florida,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I had to do it to survive.\u201d   During the board\u2019s questioning, Dr. Elizabeth D. Tucker, an obstetrician-gynecologist from Pensacola, asked Renelique about three different types of medical forceps. Renelique replied that he possessed each of the instruments.   After each question, Tucker also held up a metal instrument, different from the one she had named and inquired about. One of the tools was a metal rod with an arrow attached at the tip.   Tucker asked Renelique if he had that. He replied that he did.   \u201cFor the record, these are from my antique collection,\u201d she said later. \u201cWe don\u2019t use these in terminations.\u201d   Renelique\u2019s attorney, Joseph Harrison, later requested that his client view the instruments more closely, which the board allowed. Renelique said he had never seen or used the spear in his life.   Renelique said he had advised the patient to come in early as a precaution, and that when he was en route to the clinic, he was called to tend to another patient having an emergency.   He said the clinic staff members didn\u2019t tell him about the delivery when he arrived.   Harrison said Renelique expected the board to uphold the current restriction on his license, which prohibits him from performing abortions unless another physician is present. The Department of Health recommended that his license be suspended. But the board decided to revoke it instead which means he will not be able to practice medicine in Florida.   No criminal charges have been filed in the case, but the state attorney\u2019s office is investigating.",

    "2009 - 2767": "  ALBANY \u2013 Gov. Paterson yesterday was blasted by public-employee unions, legislative Republicans and even fellow Democrats for granting sky-high pay hikes to his key staffers at a time when he\u2019s asking 130,000 state workers to give up their 3 percent raises.   \u201cThis will demoralize our members even further,\u201d said Stephen Madarasz, a spokesman for the Civil Service Employees Association, which represents 70,000 state workers.   \u201cFrankly, it doesn\u2019t come as a great surprise to us because we\u2019ve been very disappointed in the way the governor has been handling the fiscal crisis from the start.\u201d   As for Paterson\u2019s request that state workers give up the 3 percent hikes they\u2019re due to receive April 1 or risk massive layoffs, Madarasz declared flatly, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do it.\u201d   An apparently shocked spokeswoman for the Public Employees Federation, which represents 59,000 state workers said only, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to comment because the story speaks for itself.\u201d   The Post disclosed yesterday that Paterson had secretly granted raises of as much as 46 percent to more than a dozen staffers since August, when he claimed an \u201cemergency\u201d fiscal crisis required a tough hiring freeze and a reduction in state spending.   The pay hikes, costing about $250,000 annually, went to many of Paterson\u2019s top staffers, including his chief of staff, William Cunningham, whose annual pay rose $8,500, to $178,500, or 5 percent, and his deputy, Charlotte Hitchcock, who received an $18,000 increase, to $178,000, for an 11.25 percent hike.   Senate Minority Leader Dean Skelos (R-Nassau) said the size and scope of the pay hikes \u201cshow the governor just doesn\u2019t get it.\u201d   \u201cWhether it\u2019s raising taxes or secretly raising his staff salaries, the trip to Europe, the luxury hotel stay in Washington . . . he\u2019s asking everyone to sacrifice during these difficult times \u2013 except for him and his staff,\u201d Skelos said.   Meanwhile, a prominent Democrat who has worked with Paterson called the raises \u201cdisastrous\u201d and said, \u201cDavid ought to be leading by example and showing his staff he can do more with less, and not less with more, which, frankly, appears to be the case.   \u201cIf he keeps it up, he\u2019ll be finished as governor,\u201d added the Democrat, who demanded anonymity.   Paterson has been sinking in recent public-opinion polls in the wake of a string of missteps, including the mishandling of the selection of Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s Senate replacement; an aborted junket to Davos, Switzerland; a $20,000-plus four-day stay at President Obama\u2019s inauguration; politically unpopular plans to tax sodas and Internet downloads; and repeated flip-flops on whether he backs higher taxes for the wealthy.<em><a href=\"mailto:fredric.dicker@nypost.com\">fredric.dicker@nypost.com</a></em>",
    "2009 - 2229": "  VATICAN CITY \u2013 Pope Benedict XVI on Wednesday told U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, a Catholic who supports abortion rights, that Catholic politicians have a duty to protect life \u201cat all stages of its development.\u201d  Pelosi is the first top Democrat to meet with Benedict since the election of Barack Obama, who won a majority of the American Catholic vote despite differences with the Vatican on abortion.  The Vatican released the pope\u2019s remarks to Pelosi, saying Benedict spoke of the church\u2019s teaching \u201con the dignity of human life from conception to natural death.\u201d That is an expression often used by the pope when expressing opposition to abortion.  Benedict said all Catholics \u2013 especially legislators, jurists and political leaders \u2013 should work to create \u201ca just system of laws capable of protecting human life at all stages of its development.\u201d  In an e-mail issued by her office, Pelosi did not mention the allusion to abortion.  She said it was with \u201cgreat joy\u201d that she and her husband, Paul, met with Benedict.  \u201cIn our conversation, I had the opportunity to praise the Church\u2019s leadership in fighting poverty, hunger and global warming, as well as the Holy Father\u2019s dedication to religious freedom and his upcoming trip and message to Israel,\u201d she said.  The 15-minute meeting was closed to reporters and photographers. The two met in a small room off a Vatican auditorium after the pope\u2019s weekly public audience.  The Vatican said it was not issuing a photo of the meeting \u2013 as it usually does when the pope meets world leaders \u2013 saying the encounter was private. The statement said the pope \u201cbriefly greeted\u201d Pelosi and did not mention any other subject they may have discussed.  A number of the bishops in the United States have questioned Pelosi\u2019s stance on abortion, particularly her theological defense of her support for abortion rights.  Benedict has cautiously welcomed Obama\u2019s new Democratic administration, although several American cardinals have sharply criticized its support for abortion rights. The new stance is a sharp break from government policy under former President George W. Bush.  Pelosi had meetings with Italian leaders in the past few days, including Premier Silvio Berlusconi.",

    "2009 - 1233": " State health officials yanked a creepy Upper East Side shrink\u2019s license yesterday after finding that he slept with two of his patients \u2013 impregnating one and paying for her to have an abortion.   Dr. Reed Moskowitz, 62, a professor of psychiatry at NYU and author of \u201cYour Healing Mind,\u201d had claimed at a hearing that his patients had simply confused fantasy with reality, but the state Health Department deemed the patients\u2019 testimony more credible.   In the first case, the patient, a 48-year-old woman who began seeing Moskowitz professionally in 1983, said they carried on a sexual relationship for 11 years.   Before they ended their relationship in 1994, Moskowitz allegedly began a sexual relationship with a 51-year-old patient. When she became pregnant, Moskowitz allegedly paid for her to have an abortion.   On his doctor\u2019s statement on the state Health Department Web site, Moskowitz wrote that in his therapy the \u201cfocus is on the client taking an active role in their healing process.\u201d   The Health Department\u2019s Office of Professional Medical Conduct also found that Moskowitz lied on his application for credentials from NYU and for malpractice insurance by not stating he was under investigation starting last March.

    "2009 - 2916": "  The incoming archbishop of New York says he\u2019ll be a \u201ctourist for one year\u201d as he samples the Big Apple\u2019s heavenly delights \u2013 among them a brand-new Yankee Stadium and top-notch eateries.   \u201cI relish the prospect of being a citizen of New York,\u201d Archbishop Timothy Dolan, 59, said in an exclusive interview with The Post in Milwaukee, where he will end his tenure as head of that archdiocese in two months.   Asked if he will use St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral as a bully pulpit to advocate Catholic views on national social issues \u2013 including opposition to abortion \u2013 the burly Irish-American cleric said firmly, \u201cYou can plan on it.\u201d   \u201cI will talk about the principles,\u201d said Dolan. \u201cEvery person needs dignity and respect. That follows right from the Gospel.\u201d   But even as he preaches, the St. Louis native needs to learn the ins and outs of his vast new archdiocese, which stretches nearly 200 miles from Staten Island, through Manhattan and The Bronx and to counties north.   \u201cI have to spend the next year listening to people, meeting people and going to events,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to earn the love and trust of the people.\u201d   Dolan already got some love Monday when he was introduced to the city.   \u201cThe friendliness, the warmth and the radiance of the people of New York \u2013 it was genuine and sincere,\u201d Dolan said. \u201cThe people couldn\u2019t have embraced me more warmly.\u201d   He returned the favor, thanking a Post reporter yesterday for New York gifts he left at his Milwaukee office earlier this month, when Dolan was only rumored to be the replacement for retiring New York Archbishop Edward Cardinal Egan. They included a Yankees cap and mug, an FDNY T-shirt and a subway map.   That map should come in handy.   \u201cI\u2019m going to be a tourist for one year,\u201d Dolan said.   Near the top of his to-do list is a visit to the new Yankee Stadium. And as someone who enjoys a hearty meal, he\u2019s also eager to sample Gotham\u2019s wide range of cuisine.   Dolan, who enjoyed some Polish pastry yesterday morning, patted his tummy when asked what he is sacrificing for Lent, which begins today.   \u201cI do occasionally like a good cigar, and maybe a cold beer at night,\u201d said Dolan, who for now will pass on partaking in those pleasures. \u201cI\u2019m going to take on more prayer.\u201d   Dolan, like Egan and other bishops, has been criticized by advocacy groups for his handling of the pedophile-priest crisis. But he said there is no doubt that protecting youth from predators will be a top concern in New York.   \u201cWe don\u2019t have a choice in the matter. We have a charter that says we will protect the youth and the children,\u201d Dolan said. \u201cThe enemy is complacency and smugness. We can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d   The \u201cdie-hard\u201d St. Louis Cardinals fan gave a whimsical \u2013 and politically deft \u2013 answer when The Post asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite baseball team?\u201d   \u201cThe Yankees!\u201d Dolan said, before winking. \u201cDid I get that right?\u201d<em>afenner@nypost.com</em>"
