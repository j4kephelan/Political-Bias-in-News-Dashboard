The men also had sex with female prisoners who were incarcerated in the men\u2019s section of the facility. Among El Chapo\u2019s lovers was Zulema Yulia Hernandez, 23, who was serving time for robbery. El Chapo, then a married father of five, got her pregnant on at least two occasions and arranged for her to obtain abortions at the prison, according to Hernandez.Meanwhile, he ordered that an unnamed female prisoner who refused his advances be savagely beaten and raped. Hernandez writes that the drug kingpin also had food from the best Mexican restaurants delivered to his cell, as well as \u2014\u00a0perhaps unsurprisingly, given his competition with Salazar \u2014\u00a0Viagra.El Chapo, who began his <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/02/12/verdict-reached-in-el-chapo-trial/\">life of crime</a> in the 1970s as a driver for drug trafficker Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, landed in prison in 1993 for his role in the assassination of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo, who was gunned down in the parking lot of the international airport in Guadalajara.  The Catholic bishop was caught in the crossfire between rival drug traffickers and mistaken for a drug lord. In prison, Hernandez writes, El Chapo was able to pay for his lifestyle thanks to regular infusions of cash from his cousin, drug dealer Arturo Beltran Leyva. He also bribed federal guards at the Puente Grande high-security prison in Jalisco, according to the book.The cartel leader escaped in January 2001. The official version was that he <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/11/15/testimony-reveals-secrets-of-el-chapos-wild-prison-break/\">left the prison in a laundry cart</a>, but, according to Henandez, El Chapo left the building dressed as a policeman \u201cwith the complicity of many federal authorities.\u201dIn 2019, he was sentenced to life on drug-trafficking charges in the US and is serving a life sentence at a maximum-security prison in Colorado, where presumably Viagra isn\u2019t available on tap.",

    "2022 - 4031": "The Supreme Court announced Monday it will take up a case challenging Harvard University and the University of North Carolina\u2019s consideration of race in their admissions processes, which could bring about the end of <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/06/15/supreme-court-asks-doj-to-weigh-in-on-affirmative-action-case/\">affirmative action</a> in the college application process.Lower courts turned aside plaintiffs\u2019 contention that both Harvard and UNC discriminate against Asian American applicants. Arguments in the case will likely be heard this coming fall, with a decision coming sometime next year. The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has taken up a number of controversial cases this term involving issues like the expansion of Second Amendment gun rights, a direct challenge to the 1973 landmark abortion law\u00a0<em>Roe v. Wade</em>, and regulations surrounding the coronavirus pandemic.The court\u2019s most recent pronouncement on affirmative action was in 2016, in a 4-3 decision upholding the admissions program at the University of Texas against a challenge brought by a white woman. However, two members of that four-justice majority are gone from the court: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died in 2020, and Justice Anthony Kennedy retired in 2018.The three dissenters in the case, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, remain on the court.The Supreme Court consolidated two cases filed by Students for Fair Admissions, a Virginia-based group founded by anti-affirmative action activist Edward Blum.\u00a0Students for Fair Admissions sued Harvard in 2014, alleging the Ivy League school violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 barring discrimination based on race, color or national origin under any program or activity that gets federal funds.\u00a0While Harvard is a private university, it receives government money and is required to abide by federal civil rights laws.Blum\u2019s group also sued UNC in 2014, accusing the state university of wrongly using race as the main factor in admissions, violating the Constitution\u2019s 14th Amendment guaranteeing equal protection under the law by doing so.The student group is asking the justices to overturn a 2003 Supreme Court ruling in\u00a0<em>Grutter v. Bollinger</em>\u00a0that involved the University of Michigan Law School and that found colleges could consider race as one factor in the admissions process to achieve a diverse student body.\u00a0Writing for the majority, then-Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor said the Equal Protection Clause does not prohibit the school\u2019s \u201cnarrowly tailored use\u00a0of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the education benefits that flow from a diverse student body.\u201dThe high court first upheld the use of affirmative action in college admissions in its 1978 ruling in\u00a0<em>Regents of the University of California v. Bakke</em>. In that ruling, the court found that\u00a0affirmative action was constitutional, but said the use of racial quotas was not.\u00a0Blum\u2019s group argues that Harvard imposes a \u201cracial penalty\u201d on Asian-American applicants by scoring them lower in some categories than other applicants while granting \u201cmassive preferences\u201d to\u00a0blacks and Hispanics.It further claimed the school\u2019s admissions policies limited Asian-Americans to 20 percent of incoming undergraduate classes.\u00a0Harvard said its policies are not being described properly, and in 2020 a federal appeals court in Boston ruled that the school looked at race in accordance with Supreme Court precedents.According to Harvard\u2019s statistics, its freshman class is roughly one-quarter Asian American, 16\u00a0percent\u00a0African-American\u00a0and 13\u00a0percent\u00a0Hispanic.\u00a0If Harvard stopped considering race in admission programs, one lower court found it would \u201creduce African American representation at Harvard from 14% to 6% and Hispanic representation from 14% to 9%.\u201dPresident Biden\u2019s administration backs Harvard, while former President Donald Trump\u2019s Justice Department supported Blum\u2019s lawsuits.<em>With Post wires</em>",

Ron DeSantis (44 percent to 39 percent).The poll also indicated that the 45th president would cruise to the GOP nomination if he opted to enter the 2024 White House race. When asked whom they would support in a hypothetical Republican primary, 49 percent of voters chose Trump, with DeSantis a distant second at 14 percent and Pence close behind him with 13 percent support.

    "2022 - 5751": "Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer will retire at the end of the high court\u2019s current term \u2014 setting the stage for President Biden to replace him with another liberal jurist, according to reports Wednesday.Breyer, 83, is the oldest member of the Supreme Court and has been under increasing pressure from liberal Democrats to step down in recent months.The court has a 6-3 conservative majority that includes three members nominated by President Donald Trump, who tapped Amy Coney Barrett for the seat held by liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.Ginsburg died in September 2020, and Coney Barrett was confirmed by the Republican-controlled US Senate a month later in a party-line, 52-48 vote, just one week before the presidential election.Biden said during his campaign for the White House that he would nominate a black woman if he got the chance.\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to making sure there\u2019s a black woman on the Supreme Court, to make sure we in fact get every representation,\u201d he said on Feb. 25, 2020.The leading contenders include Washington, DC, federal appeals court Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, whom Biden elevated following her nomination to the federal bench by President Barack Obama.The others include high-profile civil rights lawyer Sherrilyn Ifill and federal Judge Michelle Childs, whom Biden has nominated to be an appeals court\u00a0judge.Childs is also a favorite of Rep. James Clyburn (D-SC), who made a crucial endorsement of Biden just before South Carolina\u2019s presidential primary in 2020.Biden, who was meeting with top CEOs at\u00a0the\u00a0White House in a bid to revive his stalled \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d spending plan, declined to weigh in on Breyer\u2019s retirement when reporters asked him for comment shortly after 1 pm.\u201cEvery justice has the right and opportunity to decide what he or she is going to do and announce it on their own,\u201d Biden said.\u00a0\u201cThere has been no announcement from Justice Breyer. Let him make whatever statement he\u2019s going to make and I\u2019ll be happy to talk about it later.\u201dWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki\u00a0also\u00a0said she had \u201cno additional details or information to share\u201d on Breyer\u2019s reported move.\u201cIt has always been the decision of any Supreme Court Justice if and when they decide to retire, and how they want to announce it, and that remains the case today,\u201d she tweeted\u00a0shortly after the news broke.But Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said that Biden\u2019s nominee to replace Breyer \u201cwill receive a prompt hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and will be considered and confirmed by the full United States Senate with all deliberate speed.\u201dThe Senate is now split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans, with Vice President Kamala Harris controlling the tie-breaking vote.In a prepared statement, Schumer called Breyer \u201ca model jurist\u201d who \u201cembodies the best qualities and highest ideals of American justice\u201d and \u201chas served his country with the highest possible distinction.\u201dSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), former Judiciary Committee chairman, said, \u201cJustice Breyer has always shown great respect for the institution and his colleagues, and I wish him well in the next phase of his life.\u201cAs to his replacement: If all Democrats hang together \u2013 which I expect they will \u2013 they have the power to replace Justice Breyer in 2022 without one Republican vote in support,\u201d Graham added.\u201cElections have consequences, and that is most evident when it comes to fulfilling vacancies on the Supreme Court.\u201dConey Barrett\u2019s confirmation was engineered by then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who infuriated Democrats in 2010 by blocking outgoing President Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick Garland, now US attorney general, to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia on grounds that it was an election year.McConnell, now the Senate minority leader, has vowed to <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/06/14/mcconnell-wont-allow-vote-on-biden-scotus-nominee-if-gop-regains-senate-in-2022/\">block any Biden nominations</a> to the Supreme Court in 2024 \u2014 and \u201cwait and see\u201d about 2023 \u2014 if the GOP regains control of the chamber in November.McConnell spoke to reporters in Bowling Green, Ky., on Wednesday but declined to discuss Breyer\u2019s reported retirement plans, according to CNN.\u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid to put the cart before the horse,\u201d he said.\u201cJustice Breyer has not made an official announcement and he\u2019s entitled to do that whenever he chooses to and when he does that I\u2019ll have a response to his long and distinguished career.\u201dThe Supreme Court\u2019s current term is scheduled to continue until the end of June, when it goes into recess for the summer.Breyer was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Bill Clinton and has served there since 1994.Like Ginsburg, he opted not to retire when Democrats last controlled the White House and the US Senate \u2014 which votes on Supreme Court nominees \u2014 during Obama\u2019s presidency.In July, he told CNN that he <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/07/15/justice-stephen-breyer-breaks-silence-on-retirement-calls/\">hadn\u2019t decided when to retire</a>, saying two reasons would force the move.\u201cPrimarily, of course, health.

Jackson Women\u2019s Health <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/12/01/supreme-court-to-hear-arguments-in-landmark-abortion-case/\">could ultimately overturn 1973\u2019s Roe v. Wade</a>, which established that women have a constitutional right to an abortion. The case centers on a Mississippi law that was passed in 2018 that prohibits abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, before a fetus can survive outside of the womb. The nine justices <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/10/23/supreme-court-to-hear-arguments-on-texas-abortion-law-nov-1/\">heard arguments on the law late last year</a> and will have to decide whether or not a ban on abortions before viability are in violation of the constitution.\u00a0Two New York men are challenging a state law that <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/10/31/supreme-court-to-hear-case-on-new-yorks-gun-permit-law/\">requires gun owners to prove they have a good reason</a> to carry a firearm in public when applying for a concealed carry permit. It\u2019s one of the most critical Second Amendment cases the court has heard in more than a decade and could have an impact on concealed carry laws across the US.\u00a0When a Christian organization applied to have a religious flag raised outside of Boston\u2019s City Hall, the city denied the application, prompting the group to sue, arguing the decision was a violation of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court will decide whether Boston violated the group\u2019s right to free speech.This case centers on whether or not religious institutions can benefit from public funding. Two families sued the state of Maine in 2018 after they were denied public tuition assistance because they planned to use the money for private, Christian schools. The nine justices will examine a previous ruling related to the issue and determine if religious freedom and equal protection clauses were violated.\u00a0Brought by a Guantanamo Bay detainee, this case will shape the government\u2019s \u201cstate secrets\u201d privilege, which prohibits the release of information that could have an impact on national security. Zayn al-Abidin Muhammad Husayn, also known as Abu Zubaydah, wants to subpoena CIA contractors but his request was squashed when the federal government told a lower court the testimony could have an impact on national security. During the 2000s, Zubaydah was held in a number of CIA \u201cblack sites\u201d where he was <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/05/07/trump-defends-cia-nominee-tied-to-covert-interrogation-program/\">waterboarded and subjected to other forms of torture</a>.

    "2022 - 3474": "China\u2019s ambassador to the US on Friday warned that the two countries could face a potential \u201cmilitary conflict\u201d over the status of Taiwan.Ambassador Qin Gang made the bold claim in an <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/01/28/1076246311/chinas-ambassador-to-the-u-s-warns-of-military-conflict-over-taiwan\">interview with NPR</a> on Thursday, accusing the US of encouraging Taiwan to seek independence.\u201cIf the Taiwanese authorities, emboldened by the United States, keep going down the road for independence, it most likely will involve China and the United States, the two big countries, in a military conflict,\u201d Qin said.The issue of Taiwan is \u201cthe biggest tinderbox between China and the United States,\u201d he said.China has asserted its claim over the democratic island nation, considering it a breakaway province. Earlier this week, 39 Chinese military planes <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2022/01/24/taiwan-scrambles-jets-after-chinese-warplanes-breach-airspace/\">entered Taiwan\u2019s airspace</a> in a show of force, prompting a scrambled activation of Taiwanese jets and air defense missiles. The testy incursion is the largest since October, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/10/04/china-sends-nearly-150-military-flights-over-taiwan/\">when China authorized</a> nearly 150 flights over Taiwan\u2019s air defense zone.\u00a0The State Department said in a statement to The Post on Monday that it was \u201cconcerned by the PRC\u2019s provocative military activity near Taiwan,\u201d saying it was \u201cdestabilizing, risks miscalculation, and undermines regional peace and stability.\u201d\u201cThe US commitment to Taiwan is rock solid and contributes to the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and within the region,\u201d the department added. \u201cWe will continue to stand with friends and allies to advance our shared prosperity, security, and values. We will continue to deepen our ties with democratic Taiwan.\u201dLast week, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told reporters he <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2022/01/21/michael-mccaul-predicts-chinese-invasion-of-taiwan-after-winter-olympics/\">believes China will launch an invasion of Taiwan</a> sometime after <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/12/06/white-house-announcing-diplomatic-boycott-of-winter-olympics-report/\">the Winter Olympics</a> in Beijing, which begin next Friday.In the one-on-one interview with NPR \u2014 Qin\u2019s first since assuming his post in Washington, DC last July \u2014 the ambassador discussed growing tensions in the region, as well as the upcoming Olympics.\u00a0Qin said that China\u2019s relationship with the US \u201cis the most important,\u201d despite growing tensions after Washington\u2019s decision to take part <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/12/06/white-house-announcing-diplomatic-boycott-of-winter-olympics-report/\">in a diplomatic boycott of the games</a> in protest of human-rights abuses, most notably genocidal actions against Uyghur Muslims and in the <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/06/03/uighur-exiles-describe-forced-abortions-torture-in-xinjiang/\">northwest province of Xinjiang</a>.Qin denied that there was such a genocide.\u201cThe actual condition is that Uyghur people as other ethnic groups of people, they enjoy happy life,\u201d he claimed. \u201cThey enjoy the rights and the freedom guaranteed by the constitution of China. They are a member of the big family of Chinese nation. This co-called genocide or forced labor \u2014 these are big lies of the century. There\u2019s no genocide at all.\u201d"
