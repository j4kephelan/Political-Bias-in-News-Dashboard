The doctor had been a lightning rod for anti-abortion foes, who nicknamed him \u201cTiller the baby killer.\u201dRoeder admitted killing Tiller in the foyer of Tiller\u2019s church, saying he did so to protect unborn children. He pleaded not guilty to the charge of first-degree murder.Roeder\u2019s attorneys tried to get a lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter for him, saying he acted out of the genuine conviction that he was protecting fetuses. But the judge in the case ruled the jury could not consider such a verdict.His attorneys were hoping to get a lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter for Roeder, but the judge also ruled that the jury could not consider such a verdict.

    "2010 - 2333": "You can\u2019t handle the truthiness!   Comic-pundit Stephen Colbert went on a truth-seeking mission with Harold Ford Jr., last night, roasting the likely Senate hopeful over his past statements on gay marriage and abortion rights a week after he filleted him as a flip-flopper on his late-night show.   The much-anticipated Colbert-Ford face-off came after the TV funnyman mocked the former Tennessee congressman last week for \u201cexpediency\u201d and accused him of changing positions to suit his needs.   Ford, apparently eager to prove he can take on any critic, decided to make a personal appearance on the Comedy Central show.   \u201cLast week, I gave you my Alpha Dog of the Week,\u201d Colbert said at the outset, an honor he bestowed on the potential Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand challenger on a previous show \u2014 in a clip that went viral across the Web.   Colbert joked that the six-minute interview was part of Ford\u2019s New York state residency test and added he\u2019s demonstrating he is \u201cwilling to change . . . positions to appeal to a New York audience. How do you respond to that compliment, sir?\u201d   When Ford started to answer that he was \u201cpro-choice,\u201d Colbert cut him off and repeated comments the former congressman made when he was running for the Senate in Tennessee in 2006, in which he suggested he\u2019d never been pro-choice.   \u201cDid you change [from] pro-choice to not pro-choice, was that your choice?\u201d Colbert said, to laughs.   Ford defended himself and gave the line he has given on the campaign trail to reporters about calling himself pro-life as a way to reclaim the phrase from rabid anti-abortion activists.   Ford, who only recently came out in favor of gay marriage after opposing it in Congress, said, \u201cIf you\u2019re for politicians who are static in thinking, I\u2019m not your guy.\u201d   Colbert claimed Ford was giving the media complicated opinions, \u201cYou are saying these things in the media capital of the world, New York City, Gotcha Town!\u201d Colbert said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re saying, \u2018Come and gotcha me.\u2019 \u201d   Colbert then urged Ford to find upstate Schenectady on Google Maps, and asked him if he has voted in the Big Apple since moving here a few years ago.   \u201cNo . . . but I am a registered voter,\u201d Ford said.   \u201cThat\u2019s good enough for me,\u201d Colbert replied.<em><a href=\"mailto:maggie.haberman@nypost.com\">maggie.haberman@nypost.com</a><br/>\n</em>",

    "2010 - 1515": "Former Heisman winner Tim Tebow and his mom carried the ball for an anti-abortion group yesterday, making a low-key pitch for their side of the divisive issue.   The two never mentioned the word \u201cabortion\u201d during their Focus on the Family spot, aired yesterday during the Super Bowl.   The ad was marked by an upbeat musical score and a script read almost exclusively by the star quarterback\u2019s mom.   At one point, Pam Tebow suddenly flies off the screen after she is playfully blindsided by the Heisman winner.   \u201cTimmy!\u201d she says, picking herself off the ground. \u201cI\u2019m trying to tell our story here!\u201d   In varying editions of the same basic spot, Pam Tebow recalls her difficult pregnancy.   \u201cI call him my miracle baby.

I love you, too,\u201d before they both look into the camera and smile.   The ad ends with the conservative group\u2019s trademarked, anti-abortion motto: \u201cCelebrate family. Celebrate life.\u201d   Abortion-rights advocates ripped the spot.   \u201cFocus on the Family is anti-choice and anti-gay,\u201d said a Twitter posting from the National Abortion Rights Action League, also attacking CBS, which refused to air a gay-dating ad.<em><a href=\"mailto:david.li@nypost.com\">david.li@nypost.com</a><br/>\n</em>",
    "2010 - 3111": "BOSTON \u2014 A top Massachusetts Democrat said today that one of Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s grandsons is considering carrying on the family\u2019s vaunted political tradition by running for the U.S. House of Representatives.Joseph P. Kennedy III, one of the twin sons of former Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II, may run this fall if Democratic Rep. William Delahunt decides against seeking re-election in his South Shore and Cape Cod district.Kennedy, 29, \u201chas been considering it but he hasn\u2019t made a decision,\u201d said the Democrat, who demanded anonymity to speak about private conversations with the father and son.The younger Kennedy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He is a graduate of Stanford University and Harvard Law School who works as a prosecutor in Barnstable County, near his family\u2019s Cape Cod compound.Delahunt has served in Congress since 1997, but Massachusetts incumbents were shocked in January when a little-known Republican state senator, Scott Brown, claimed the U.S. Senate seat held for nearly a half-century by Edward M. Kennedy.That prompted questions about the endurance of the Kennedy legacy and inspired several local Republicans, including former state Treasurer Joe Malone and state Rep. Jeffrey Perry of Sandwich, to say they are considering running for Delahunt\u2019s seat.Brown not only beat his Democratic opponent, Attorney General Martha Coakley, in Delahunt\u2019s district, but he also won the Barnstable precinct where the late senator lived and used to vote.Delahunt has also been criticized in recent weeks for his handling of a 1986 shooting by Amy Bishop, a University of Alabama professor accused of killing three colleagues this month. At the time, Delahunt was the local district attorney, and he accepted the findings of local and state police that Bishop\u2019s shooting of her brother was accidental.\u201cThese are rare opportunities when there is a potential open seat,\u201d said Paul Watanabe, a political science professor at UMass-Boston. \u201cHe is the Kennedy most talked about in terms of carrying on the family tradition in the U.S. House or U.S. Senate.\u201d\u201cIt has significant value in terms of fundraising ability, scaring off potential Democratic and Republican contenders, and it immediately thrusts this congressional race into national attention, rather than just one of 434 other races,\u201d Watanbe added.The uncertain political climate, however, would likely play heavily in any final decision by Kennedy, said Boston College political science professor Marc Landy.\u201cWhat is unusual is it could be a real contest, because this contest would not be fought on \u2018the Kennedy tradition.\u2019 The issues would really matter in this election. And I can\u2019t predict how the voters in that district will respond, and neither can he. And that\u2019s the big story: Will a Kennedy enter a race with that much uncertainty?\u201d said Landy.A member of the Kennedy family had served in Washington since 1946, when future President John F. Kennedy won a U.S. House seat. Joseph P. Kennedy II held that seat from 1987 to 1999, but he decided against seeking re-election after an aborted run for governor in 1998."
