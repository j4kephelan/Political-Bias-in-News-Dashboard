    "2019 - 3132": "The latest negotiations towards <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/01/08/pelosi-schumer-blast-trump-for-shutdown-over-unnecessary-border-wall/\">ending the government shutdown</a> crashed and burned Wednesday as President Trump stormed out of a White House meeting with congressional leaders\u2014 and again raised the specter of declaring a national emergency to fund a border wall.The 3 p.m. huddle began with Trump passing out candy, reportedly including Baby Ruth bars and Skittles, to lawmakers.But it quickly hit a sour note when House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) refused to promise that the wall along the border with Mexico would be funded if Republicans agreed to end the partial government shutdown, which enters its 20th day on Thursday.\u201cJust left a meeting with Chuck [Schumer] and Nancy, a total waste of time,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1083099784012091396\">Trump tweeted</a> minutes after the blown-up sit-down. \u201cI asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up, are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier?\u201d\u201cNancy said, NO,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cI said bye-bye, nothing else works!\u201dLawmakers from both sides of the aisle who were present confirmed the basic narrative of the aborted meeting, but disagreed in their characterizations of the tone.\u201cHe couldn\u2019t get his way and he just walked out of the meeting,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). \u201c[Trump] sort of slammed the table \u2026 He just walked out and said, \u2018We have nothing to discuss.\u2019\u201dRep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), the Minority Whip, denied that Trump slammed a table, describing him as \u201ccalm.\u201dThe fiery gathering capped a snowy Washington, D.C. day in which neither party yielded any ground \u2014 though Trump again teased his willingness to force the issue by declaring a national emergency.\u201cI think we might work a deal, and if we don\u2019t, I may go that route,\u201d he said, referring to an emergency declaration to fund the wall.\u201cI have the absolute right to do [a] national emergency if I want.\u201d\u201cMy threshold will be if I can\u2019t make a deal with people that are unreasonable.\u201dTrump revived the possibility of the emergency declaration in Oval Office remarks made hours before the latest tempestuous attempt at brokering a deal.Trump emerged from a Capitol Hill luncheon with Republican senators confident that party lawmakers were in \u201csolidarity.,\u201dBut cracks appeared to be forming Wednesday.\u201cI don\u2019t think [shutdowns] are a good way to govern,\u201d said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska ), one of three Republican senators to publicly call for the closure\u2019s end, along with Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, and Cory Gardner of Colorado.\u201cI think we have a sense of urgency going on right now as we approach Friday,\u201d the day on which federal workers are supposed to be paid.Before departing for that rallying luncheon, Trump verbally sparred with an ABC News reporter who questioned why the president refused to sign a spending bill then continue to haggle over border security.\u201cDo you think I should sign?\u201d Trump repeatedly asked the journalist. \u201cWould you do that in my position?\u201d",
    "2019 - 3200": "TEHRAN, Iran \u2014 A decades-old Iranian Boeing 707 military cargo plane reportedly carrying meat from Kyrgyzstan crashed Monday while trying to land west of Iran\u2019s capital, killing 15 people on board and leaving a sole survivor, authorities said.The crash of the jetliner marked just the latest aviation disaster for Iran, which hoped to replace its aging fleet under terms of the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.But instead, President Donald Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the accord in May scuttled billions of dollars in planned sales by Airbus and Boeing Co. to the Islamic Republic, only increasing the danger for passengers in Iranian planes.The aircraft, which bore the paint scheme of the Iranian air force\u2019s Saha civilian airline, was making an emergency landing around 8:30 a.m. Monday at Fath Airport, an airfield controlled by Iran\u2019s powerful paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. The plane skidded off the runway, crashed through a perimeter fence and into a residential neighborhood.Iranian state television aired images of smoke-charred homes and the fuselage of the aircraft lying on the ground in the neighborhood. Nearby was one of its landing gear, torn away. Small fires burned around it.The plane was meant to land at the nearby Payam International Airport, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Tehran, the Iranian capital.Authorities did not immediately offer a reason for the crew\u2019s decision to land there. Fath is some 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) southwest of Payam. Its runway is some 1,100 meters (3,600 feet) long, compared to Payam\u2019s 3,600 meters (11,800 feet). In November, a commercial airline reportedly mistook Fath for Payam, but was able to abort its landing.Pirhossein Koulivand, head of the country\u2019s emergency medical services, said that of the 16 people on board the plane, only the flight engineer was known to have survived. Iranian media reported nine bodies from the crash had already been recovered.Iran\u2019s air force said in a statement that the fate of the crew, including their possible \u201cmartyrdom,\u201d is under investigation. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear who owns the plane, though Gen. Shahin Taghikhani, an army spokesman, told state TV that the plane and its crew were Iranian.Iranians often use the word \u201cmartyrdom\u201d for those who die in war or national service.The plane reportedly was carrying a cargo of meat from Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan\u2019s capital, to Iran. Since 2016, Iran has been importing meat from Kyrgyzstan, usually via Saha. It imported 150 tons in 2016 and 350 tons in 2017.Saha Airlines operated one of the world\u2019s last commercial flights of the Boeing 707, which was first manufactured in 1958 and helped usher in the jet age. The four-engine, narrow-body aircraft were built until 1979.Maintenance information regarding the Boeing 707 that crashed Monday was not immediately available. However, Iran has struggled to obtain parts for its aging fleet of airlines, nearly all purchased during the time of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.Saha Airlines\u2019 Boeing 707s suffered a previous fatal crash in April 2005, when a flight coming from the Kish island crash-landed at Mehrabad Airport in Tehran, killing three passengers.",

While this longer video gives better context to the situation, it still does not absolve those boys of their behavior,\u201d AIM said.\u201cNathan Phillips is a respected elder. He stepped in to what he saw was a tense situation between the Black Hebrew Israelites, who were yelling harmful things at Natives and the school group, and the school group who were becoming increasingly worked up.\u201d",
    "2019 - 4793": "The high school student whose face-off with a Native American elder at the steps of the Lincoln Memorial went viral insisted in a new interview that he was not \u201cdisrespectful\u201d toward the activist \u2014 but wishes he\u2019d have <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/01/21/longer-video-casts-new-light-on-native-american-taunting-controversy/\">just walked away from the incident</a>.\u201cAs far as standing there, I had every right to do so,\u201d Nick Sandmann, a junior at Covington Catholic High School in Park Hills, Kentucky, <a href=\"https://www.today.com/news/nick-sandmann-interview-today-show-s-savannah-guthrie-encounter-native-t147242\">said on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show</a>, his first TV interview since the incident with 64-year-old Nathan Phillips in Washington, DC.Host Savannah Guthrie asked the 16-year-old in the interview that aired Wednesday whether he felt he owed anyone an apology.\u201cMy position is that I was not disrespectful to Mr. Phillips. I respect him. I\u2019d like to talk to him,\u201d Sandmann replied.\u201cI mean, in hindsight, I wish we could\u2019ve walked away and avoided the whole thing. But I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m sorry for listening to him and standing there,\u201d he added.The stand-off occurred Saturday during Sandmann\u2019s trip with his classmates to DC to attend a March for Life anti-abortion rally.Wearing a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap, the youngster was captured on video standing toe to toe with Phillips, who was returning from a separate march.The scene played out right after the classmates ran into several members of the Black Hebrew Israelites, a radical movement that the Southern Poverty Law Center has said is \u201cgrowing more militant.\u201dThe Hebrew Israelites began taunting the teens.\u201cThey started shouting a bunch of homophobic, racist, derogatory comments at us,\u201d Sandmann said on \u201cToday.\u201d \u201cI heard them call us incest kids, bigots, racists. They called us f\u2014\u2013s.\u201dAlthough the students outnumbered their opponents, Sandmann said he \u201cdefinitely felt threatened.\u201d\u201cThey were a group of adults and I wasn\u2019t sure what was going to happen next,\u201d he said, adding that his chaperone gave the kids permission to shout school spirit chants to drown out the Hebrew Israelites.\u201cIn hindsight, I wish we had just found another spot to wait for our buses. But at the time, being positive seemed better than letting them slander us with all of these things,\u201d Sandmann said.But he insisted that none of the students yelled insults or racial slurs at the group.\u201cWe\u2019re a Catholic school and it\u2019s not tolerated. They don\u2019t tolerate racism, and none of my classmates are racist people,\u201d he said.Phillips, who played a drum during an Indigenous Peoples March, has said he approached the students, hoping to defuse the tension between them and the Black Hebrew Israelites.\u201cI intervened and things just escalated from there,\u201d he said earlier this week.The Omaha Nation elder has been assailed online for approaching Sandmann. President Trump has slammed the media <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/01/22/trump-slams-evil-media-for-coverage-of-smiling-teen-native-american/\">for treating the teen and his classmates \u201cunfairly.\u201d</a>\u201cI\u2019m not sure where he wanted to go. And if he wanted to walk past me, I would\u2019ve let him go,\u201d Sandmann said, adding that some of his friends wondered whether Phillips was trying to join them and drum along with their chants.Sandmann also was asked about his facial expression as he faced off against Phillips \u2014 a look some have described as a smirk.\u201cI see it as a smile, saying that this is the best you\u2019re going to get out of me. You won\u2019t get any further reaction of aggression. And I\u2019m willing to stand here as long as you want to hit this drum in my face,\u201d he said.Sandmann said it was unfair to judge him based on one look.\u201cPeople have judged me based off one expression, which I wasn\u2019t smirking, but people have assumed that\u2019s what I have,\u201d he said.\u201cAnd they\u2019ve gone from there to titling me and labeling me as a racist person, someone that\u2019s disrespectful to adults, which they\u2019ve had to assume so many things to get there without consulting anyone that can give them the opposite story,\u201d he said.The student acknowledged that if he and his classmates weren\u2019t wearing the \u201cMAGA\u201d caps, which he said he had bought from a street vendor moments earlier, things might have turned out differently.\u201cThat\u2019s possible. But I would have to assume what Mr. Phillips was thinking and I\u2019d rather let him speak for why he came up to us,\u201d he said.Sandmann said he has received both messages of support and hostility after the episode, but doesn\u2019t want to live his life in fear.\u201cI have the utmost respect for Mr. Phillips as another person that freely used his First Amendment right. And I want to thank him for his military service as well. And I\u2019d certainly like to speak with him,\u201d he said.",
