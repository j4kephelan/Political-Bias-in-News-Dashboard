    "2007 - 1462": "Giants star Amani Toomer and his estranged wife led off the opening quarter in their bitter divorce contest in New Jersey court yesterday by meeting behind closed doors with the judge.   Toomer and his wife, Dr. Yola Dabrowski, appeared in Hudson County Family Court for the first time in their bid to settle the yearlong fight that has seen nasty allegations of her aborting four pregnancies rather than have children with him.   The pair and their lawyers spent four hours behind closed doors hammering out the details of their split.   At one point Dabrowski\u2019s lawyer, Tom Snyder, traded barbs with Toomer\u2019s attorney, Robert Penza, making fun of what Toomer had been harping on: the issue of money.   \u201cShe\u2019s so greedy, she wants more and more and more,\u201d Snyder sarcastically joked to Penza.   Afterwards, both Penza and Snyder acknowledged there had been at least one first down completed on what has been a long drive toward a resolution.   \u201cI think we made some progress on some things,\u201d Penza said.   \u201cI think we are all in the same place. Everyone wants a positive outcome,\u201d Snyder added.   Toomer, 32, said after the hearing: \u201cI just want to come to a reasonable agreement. That\u2019s it.\u201d   Snyder said of the claim that Dabrowski, 34, had four abortions: \u201cThe allegations with respect to the pregnancy termination are completely, totally, 100 percent false.\u201d<em><a class=\"a10blb\" href=\"mailto:jeane.macintosh@nypost.com\">jeane.macintosh@nypost.com</a></em>",
    "2007 - 2637": "Rudy Giuliani\u2019s liberal views could wreck the GOP, John McCain is an \u201cunreliable leader,\u201d Hillary Rodham Clinton is just like France \u2013 and Mitt Romney has \u201ctoo-perfect\u201d hair, according to an internal Romney campaign report. The blistering strategy report, a 77-page Power-Point presentation, reveals concerns that the former Massachusetts governor is prone to flip-flopper charges, and lists opponents\u2019 vulnerabilities that are ripe for exploiting. The document could be damaging to Romney, several GOP insiders said, further hurting his efforts to try to climb to the top tier in the polls alongside Giuliani and McCain. Giuliani is described as an outside-Washington \u201crock star and truth teller\u201d who \u201cearned the nation\u2019s trust for his leadership\u201d after 9/11, according to the Boston Globe, which obtained the report. But he\u2019s also described as a \u201cone-dimensional Lone Ranger whose social views \u2013 he supports abortion rights and civil unions for gay couples \u2013 could destroy the \u2018GOP brand.\u2019 \u201c \u201cWe can\u2019t disqualify Dems like Hillary on social issues ever again\u201d if Giuliani wins, the notes say. They highlight the ex-mayor\u2019s \u201cethical issues,\u201d such as his ties to disgraced Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, and alludes to his \u201cpersonal political liabilities\u201d \u2013 apparently his three marriages. McCain is a maverick war hero famed for \u201cstraight talk,\u201d the document says, but he\u2019s \u201ctoo close to [the Democratic] Left\u201d and is an \u201cuncertain, erratic, unreliable leader in uncertain times,\u201d the report says. Another major point throughout the report is criticism of Europe \u2013 especially France \u2013 saying, \u201cThat\u2019s where Hillary and Dems would take us. Hillary = France.\u201d The report looks at ways to make Romney a breakout \u201cbrand,\u201d and concedes it will be tough for him to do that with both Giuliani and McCain in the race. It expresses concern about Romney\u2019s well-coiffed mane being \u201ctoo perfect.\u201d It also says he can put distance between himself and President Bush by highlighting \u201cintelligence.\u201d Romney spokesman Kevin Madden said, \u201cOutside consultants routinely offer input and analysis \u2013 both solicited and unsolicited \u2013 on the dynamics of a political campaign all the time. But we cannot and will not verify any documents that are not marked Romney for President Inc.\u201d The Giuliani and McCain campaigns declined comment, and McCain aides said he\u2019s focused on serious issues such as Iraq. Clinton spokesman Blake Zeff said, \u201cGiven his propensity for flip-flopping, if Mr. Romney doesn\u2019t like France today, he\u2019ll probably decide to move there tomorrow.\u201d<a class=\"a10blb\" href=\"mailto:maggie.haberman@nypost.com\">maggie.haberman@nypost.com</a>",
    "2007 - 1329": "One-third of voters take issue with a presidential candidate who supports gun control or has been married three times like Rudy Giuliani, a new Time magazine poll shows.   The numbers indicate potential potholes for the current Republican front-runner as his bid for president kicks into gear.   According to the survey, 30 percent couldn\u2019t back a candidate who favors gun control, while another 35 percent have trouble with someone with three marriages.   That includes 48 percent of \u201cborn-again\u201d white Christians.   But the survey also shows 56 percent don\u2019t know Giuliani\u2019s marital history, 68 percent don\u2019t know his stand on gun control (he\u2019s been saying it\u2019s a state matter), and nearly 80 percent don\u2019t accurately know where he is on gay marriage (he\u2019s against it) or abortion rights (he favors it).   That suggests Giuliani is partly an unknown quantity nationally \u2013 although the poll is the latest one to show him with a double-digit lead over Arizona Sen. John McCain, beating him 38 percent to 24 percent.   McCain made clear yesterday he will battle hard, telling Dave Letterman he\u2019s running, and hitting Giuliani\u2019s home turf to be honored at an Irish-American event in Midtown.   Giuliani barely leads Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, 47 percent to 44 percent, according to the poll of 1,144 registered voters nationwide.",
    "2007 - 1496": " A city child-welfare agency supervisor was sentenced to 18 to 24 years in prison yesterday for repeatedly raping his two teenage daughters, starting when they were 8 and 14, along with two other girls who were family friends.   The horrific rapes were sometimes violent and continued for years, despite his victims\u2019 tears. He raped his youngest victim \u2013 actually his oldest daughter -for 14 years, beginning when she was 8. She had an abortion at 18 \u2013 and the fiend has admitted to cops his likely paternity.   \u201cYou told me that no matter what, I would always have daddy, and I believed you and trusted you,\u201d the man\u2019s younger daughter, now 16, told a Manhattan Supreme Court judge in a statement read by prosecutor Robert Ferrari.   \u201cI looked up to you,\u201d the prosecutor read, as the statement\u2019s author stood sobbing at his side.   \u201cI wanted to be just like you \u2013 a social worker. You failed your children. You failed yourself. \u201d   \u201cI have no father,\u201d the statement concluded. \u201cA father does not harm a child, his child. I don\u2019t hate you and I hope God forgives you.\u201d   The 255-pound, 42-year-old former supervisor for the Administration for Children\u2019s Services, whose name is being withheld to protect the victims\u2019 identities, has claimed he himself was abused as a child.   \u201cI do apologize,\u201d he told the court before sentencing. \u201cThis has been the most difficult thing I\u2019ve ever faced in my life.\u201d<em><a class=\"a10blb\" href=\"mailto:laura.italiano@nypost.com\">laura.italiano@nypost.com</a></em>",
    "2007 - 2068": " WASHINGTON \u2013 Rudy Giuliani\u2019s liberal stance on abortion, guns and gays wasn\u2019t his biggest problem yesterday as he addressed a conference of conservative activists \u2013 it was his having dressed in drag.   A whisper campaign targeting the front-running GOP White House contender\u2019s cross-dressing stunts at gala political dinners in New York and on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d was the hot topic among right-leaning activists.   \u201cA lot of people are talking about it. It\u2019s not respectable. They use it as a way to highlight all of his other shortcomings,\u201d Las Vegas conservative Bruce Feher told The Post.   Giuliani, who addressed the key gathering yesterday, may top national GOP presidential polls, but conservatives already uneasy with Giuliani\u2019s positions on social issues were latching on to his gags as a drag queen.   \u201cCan you think of any president \u2013 even Clinton \u2013 or another candidate wearing a dress on several occasions? It\u2019s unpresidential. It\u2019s not a secret, but a lot of people don\u2019t know about it, and it\u2019s only going to get more attention,\u201d said Florida GOPer Gregg Shore.   \u201cIt lends credence to the belief that he\u2019s not conservative.\u201d   \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be an issue if it weren\u2019t for the fact that his views on every conservative value weren\u2019t so far to the left. But it resonates here,\u201d said Georgia conservative Justin Lewis Wight.   Anti-Giuliani Republicans also circulated newspaper clips accusing America\u2019s Mayor of appointing left-leaning judges.   Giuliani received ovations from the capacity crowd at the Omni Shoreham hotel in D.C. \u2013 and garnered loud cheers when he talked tough on terrorism.   Giuliani took a veiled shot at Hillary Rodham Clinton by mocking her tortured refusal to admit to liberal voters that her vote for the Iraq war was a mistake.   Explaining his mayoral missteps in reforming the city\u2019s schools, \u201cI made mistakes. I\u2019m going to admit them and apologize for them,\u201d Giuliani said to only scattered guffaws.   \u201cSome people got it,\u201d he quipped.<em><a class=\"a10blb\" href=\"mailto:ian.bishop@nypost.com\">ian.bishop@nypost.com</a></em>",
    "2007 - 1240": "  WASHINGTON \u2013 Rudy Giuliani is surging ahead of such GOP big guns as Sen. John McCain for the GOP presidential nomination, a poll shows.   The Newsweek poll suggests that Republicans and social conservatives are so far either tolerant or unaware of the ex-mayor\u2019s liberal views on gay marriage and abortion.   Giuliani leads McCain by 59 to 34 percent and Mitt Romney by 70 to 20 percent. In a late-January Newsweek poll, Giuliani\u2019s led McCain by 48 to 44 percent.   According to the poll, 82 percent of registered Republicans say a candidate\u2019s marital history is not an important consideration. Giuliani has been married three times.   And while most say they\u2019re unfamiliar with Giuliani\u2019s stance on numerous social issues, when informed of his positions, the voters claim not to mind.   Giuliani also showed strongly in a straw poll taken at the Conservative Political Action Committee\u2019s annual conference yesterday. He came in second, just four percent behind Romney but five percent ahead of McCain.   Giuliani also wins when first and second choices are combined, topping Romney by five percent.   \u201cIt\u2019s clear he\u2019s a very strong candidate, even with conservatives, despite his record,\u201d said Heather Smith, of Young Voters Strategies.

    "2007 - 2670": " If Plan A was handing out 26 million subway-themed NYC condoms, Mayor Bloomberg has now turned to Plan B: promoting the use of the \u201cmorning after\u201d contraception pill.   The city Health Department has awarded a $600,000 contract to Columbia University-Harlem Health Center to provide clinical and counseling services to teens and young women about sexually transmitted diseases, HIV and \u201cpregnancy prevention\u201d \u2013 including using the Plan B pill.   The program, which was blasted by religious and conservative leaders, will develop educational materials about the morning-after pill, including a DVD, a Web site and posters. Materials will be used in workshops and counseling sessions and be given to Plan B providers.   \u201cAs part of the program, doctors and other health professionals can provide emergency contraception, as well as other reproductive health services to clients at the clinic,\u201d the Health Department said.   The funding will serve about 3,000 youths and adults up to age 24 for at least three years.   \u201cAbstinence is the best way to prevent pregnancy. For teens who are sexually active, using birth control and condoms consistently is critical to prevent pregnancies and STDs,\u201d said Deborah Kaplan, the Health Department\u2019s assistant commissioner of reproductive health.   \u201cEmergency contraception is an option if a condom breaks, after unprotected sex, or after rape.\u201d   Clerics and conservatives accused city officials of promoting sex among youths.   \u201cThe morning-after pill can be abortion at the very early stages. The Catholic Church is opposed to that,\u201d said Joseph Zwilling, spokesman for Edward Cardinal Egan.   State Conservative Party leader Mike Long said, \u201cThis smacks of a valueless society. The health commissioner [Dr. Thomas Frieden] is encouraging teens to be promiscuous and destroying human life.\u201d   But health officials defended Plan B/emergency contraception as an option \u2013 given the number of young people who are sexually active.   Studies show that nearly half of city public high-school students report having had sexual intercourse, and more than 60 percent of pregnancies are unintended. Babies born to teens are at higher risk of low birth weight, infant mortality or living in poverty.   The Food and Drug Administration last year lifted the prescription requirement for most women to obtain the morning-after pill. Now, women 18 and over can buy Plan B without a prescription. Teens 17 and under still require a doctor\u2019s note for a prescription.   The morning-after pill is designed to prevent pregnancy if taken within 72 hours.<em><a class=\"a10blb\" href=\"mailto:carl.campanile@nypost.com\">carl.campanile@nypost.com</a></em>",
    "2007 - 1477": " WASHINGTON \u2013 Rudy Giuliani angled to shore up his conservative standing yesterday by rolling out his newest presidential campaign supporter: Southern social conservative Sen. David Vitter.   Vitter, a Louisiana Republican who opposes abortion, gay marriage and gun control, was introduced yesterday as Giuliani\u2019s Southern regional chairman and immediately assured conservatives that America\u2019s Mayor\u2019s isn\u2019t running \u201cto advance any liberal social agenda.\u201d   Meanwhile, as Giuliani moved to lock up the GOP base, a new CNN/Opinion Research poll showed him opening a double-digit lead over chief rival John McCain.   The national survey of 401 Republicans found Giuliani pulling in 34 percent, compared to the slumping Arizona senator\u2019s 18 percent. Ex-Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and ex-House Speaker Newt Gingrich each checked in at 9 percent.   The low-profile Vitter is Giuliani\u2019s first major backer from south of the Mason-Dixon Line, where Giuliani\u2019s moderate brand of Republicanism traditionally doesn\u2019t hunt.   But Vitter said the leadership Giuliani displayed on 9/11 trumped any social shortcomings. That trait is one many Louisianans believe was lacking among state and federal officials during Hurricane Katrina.   \u201cRudy has the strong, unwavering leadership and sound judgment we need in this time of war and terrorist threat,\u201d Vitter said in a news conference in Washington. <em><a class=\"a10blb\" href=\"mailto:ian.bishop@nypost.com\">ian.bishop@nypost.com</a></em>"
