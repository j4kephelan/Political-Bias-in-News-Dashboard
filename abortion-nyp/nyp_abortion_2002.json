    "2002 - 2094": "An anti-abortion extremist sent phony anthrax letters to 450 abortion clinics across the nation, authorities said yesterday.  Clayton Lee Waagner, one of the FBI\u2019s top 10 fugitives, has taken responsibility for sending the letters, which contained a harmless, white powder, Attorney General John Ashcroft said.  Waagner told an anti-abortion activist he was behind the letters during a visit to Georgia last week, according to police.  The FBI, which is offering a $50,000 reward for Waagner\u2019s capture, considers him \u201cextremely dangerous,\u201d Assistant Director Ruben Garcia said.  \u201cHe is extremely intelligent and computer-savvy. He has proven to be extremely resourceful in eluding law-enforcement authorities.\u201d  Waagner, a heavy gambler who is fond of drinking Crown Royal bourbon, is a self-described \u201canti-abortion warrior\u201d who admitted stalking abortion clinics around the country, Ashcroft said.  During the second week in October, Waagner mailed phony anthrax letters to 280 abortion clinics on the East Coast, the attorney general said.  The envelopes were marked \u201cTime Sensitive\u201d and \u201cUrgent Security Notice Enclosed\u201d and bore return addresses of the U.S. Marshals Service or the Secret Service. The letters were signed \u201cthe Army of God.\u201d  During the first week of November, Waagner sent a second wave of letters to 270 clinics via FedEx, Ashcroft said.  The Feminist Majority Foundation said clinics in at least 12 states received the letters. None of the white powder tested positive for anthrax.  Waagner, 44, escaped in February from a Clinton, Ill., jail where he was awaiting sentencing on firearms and auto-theft convictions. Since his escape, he is believed to have pulled off several of bank robberies.  Police said that on Sept. 7, Waagner abandoned a car on a highway in Memphis after colliding with a tractor-trailer. A pipe bomb, weapons and anti-abortion literature were found in the car.  Waagner was busted in September 1999 after entering Illinois with his wife and eight children in a stolen RV, which had four stolen handguns under the driver\u2019s seat, authorities said.",
    "2002 - 1621": "A furor has erupted over claims that women who have an abortion could double their chances of developing breast cancer.  The pro-life group LIFE funded a study concluding that over the next quarter-century, up to 50 percent of breast cancer cases in England and Wales could be \u201cattributable to abortion.\u201d  But top obstetricians and gynecologists have debunked that conclusion and accused LIFE of \u201cmischief-making.\u201d  Scientists behind the study says the connection may be due to estrogen levels rising significantly during the first three months of pregnancy.  But Professor Allan Templeton of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in London, insisted:  \u201cNo casual link between abortion and breast cancer has been proven. We do not support the sensational reporting of this study which serves no other function than causing anxiety amongst women. This report should not influence women in making decisions about abortion at difficult times in their life.\u201d  The research analyzed breast cancer and abortion rates in Britain, Finland, Sweden and the Czech Republic.  It made a statistical link between rising cases of breast cancer and an increase in abortion rates since it was legalized.  The study said the total number of breast cancer cases was expected to more than double from 35,110 in 1997 to 77,000 in 2023, \u201clargely\u201d because of abortions by women who haven\u2019t yet had a baby.  Ann Furedi of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, a pro-choice organization, said.  \u201cLIFE is trying to exploit health concerns for their own moral and political reasons. It really is very manipulative and inexcusable.\u201d",
    "2002 - 1651": "A photocopier\u2019s \u201cfingerprint\u201d may help investigators track down the suspect responsible for sending anthrax-laced letters to two politicians.  FBI agents have now determined that the poisoned letters sent to Sen. Patrick Leahy and Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle are virtually identical, leading them to look for a possible Kinko\u2019s connection.  FBI sources told Time magazine that because the letter sent to Leahy was photocopied, they may stand a better chance of determining who sent it. Photocopiers tend to leave a \u201cfingerprint\u201d caused by tiny scratches and dirt on the machine\u2019s glass and optical system.  The FBI lab plans to examine the Leahy letter for these tiny anomalies and try to determine which copier the suspect or suspects may have used.  While the agency can\u2019t examine every copier in the country, once they get a line on suspects, they\u2019ll be able to focus on copy businesses and libraries near their homes, Time reports.  Of particular interest would be high-volume copy companies like Kinko\u2019s. The office giant has had a number of notorious customers recently, including the Sept. 11 terrorists who attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Several of the air pirates made their flight reservations at a Kinko\u2019s in Florida.  In addition, anti-abortion zealot Clayton Lee Waagner, who allegedly sent hoax anthrax letters to clinics, was busted last week at a Kinko\u2019s in the Cincinnati area where he used the e-mail and visited extremist Web sites.  Meanwhile, public tours of the U.S. Capitol resumed Saturday for the first time since the terror attacks. Security fears were ignited by the attacks and the anthrax scares.",
    "2002 - 3473": "After all the battles Mayor Giuliani has fought at City Hall in the last eight years, he\u2019s about to tackle what could be one of his toughest \u2013 leaving.  Last night, he began the transition on a light note.  Singing a Shirelles\u2019 tune and wishing viewers a happy holidays, Rudy Giuliani made his final Saturday Night Live appearance as New York City mayor.  During the last live show of 2001, Giuliani \u2013 whose two-term tenure ends Dec. 31 \u2013 joined comic co-anchors Tina Fey and Jimmy Fallon for a playful \u201cWeekend Update\u201d news segment.  Met with applause and chants of \u201cRudy,\u201d hizzoner answered affirmative to Fey\u2019s question if he has to leave, but waved off Fallon\u2019s adoring query: \u201cCan we go with you?\u201d  \u201cWhere I\u2019m going is a lonely frontier of risk and solitude,\u201d Giuliani said.  \u201cI thought you were going to be a consultant,\u201d Fallon countered.  \u201cWhatever,\u201d joked Rudy, who will be setting up with the accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Young.  The trio then belted out an off-key rendition of the Shirelles\u2019 \u201cWill You Love Me Tomorrow,\u201d with Fey donning a Statue of Liberty headpiece and Fallon wearing a Giuliani \u201ccomb-over\u201d clip-on.  It\u2019s the fourth time Giuliani played NBC\u2019s late-night comedy show.  \u201cHe was made for the job of being mayor of the City of New York,\u201d said Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari, a longtime Giuliani ally.  Giuliani, scheduled to make the first of his formal farewell speeches this week, is in a unique position \u2013 the only New York mayor to be forced out by term limits and not an election.  And even though Giuliani insists he\u2019s anxious to return to private life, others suspect the mayor is more wistful than he has let on in recent interviews.  \u201cI think he\u2019s suffering more than I did,\u201d said former Mayor Koch, who left after three terms at the end of 1989, before term limits were introduced in 1993.  \u201cIn all his discussions, there\u2019s a poignancy, a gentle side of Giuliani you never see, the stress of leaving,\u201d Koch said.  Starting in mid-1999, Giuliani was often AWOL from City Hall \u2013 away with girlfriend Judith Nathan, raising money for his aborted Senate run and then, last year, dealing with prostate cancer and his crumbling marriage to Donna Hanover.  But since City Hall reopened after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the mayor\u2019s silver SUV waits for him outside City Hall until well after the sun goes down.  For a man with just two weeks left on the job, Giuliani has been operating on a surprisingly typical long-day schedule.  He still huddles with his top staff daily at an 8 a.m. City Hall powwow. He\u2019s still negotiating with Council Speaker Peter Vallone over budget cuts and went to a fund-raiser for the speaker\u2019s new political action committee on Wednesday.  He still goes to funerals for victims of the trade center attack and worries about caring for their families, sources said.  Giuliani has been packing up his office -while his estranged wife slowly moves her things from Gracie Mansion to an Upper East Side apartment.  \u201cDonna and the [couple\u2019s two] children are going to have a small New Year\u2019s Eve party in Gracie Mansion and they\u2019re going to be finishing it at their new apartment,\u201d said Hanover spokeswoman Joannie Danielides.  As the worldwide face of New York\u2019s mournful but tough resiliency after the terrorist attacks, Giuliani recently sat down for wide-ranging chats with internationally known television interviewers, including Barbara Walters and David Frost.  page 18 in metro &amp; sports",
    "2002 - 2076": "<strong>M</strong>AYOR Bloomberg\u2019s team figures there\u2019s a special incentive to make sure President Bush does well by New York \u2013 the commander in chief is so popular these days that if he keeps it up, he just might be able to win the state in 2004.  \u201cCould a President Bush, who didn\u2019t exactly do well in New York, put it in play in 2004? It\u2019s not out of reach,\u201d insists Bloomberg strategist Bill Cunningham.  Indeed, some Democrats were startled at the loud applause that greeted Bloomberg\u2019s mention of Bush\u2019s name in his inaugural speech.  If Bush can win New York, Democrats can forget the next presidential race. There is no Democratic scenario for winning the White House without New York.  A long shot? Sure. But Bush doesn\u2019t have to <em>win</em> \u2013 if he can just force Democrats to spend time and money fighting for New York, they\u2019re dead.  In 1988, Democrat Mike Dukakis was a sure loser when he had to fight Bush\u2019s dad for New York down to the final weeks. The last Republican to win the state was Ronald Reagan in 1984.  To some extent, this is kabuki theater. Even Democrats who\u2019ll campaign against Bush in 2004 want him to think he just might win the state. \u201cIf it gets him to give us more money [in aid to New York], I\u2019m all for it,\u201d says one.  But the Bush New York strategy, now being talked up in GOP circles, is that a unique set of circumstances could give the president a real shot at making it in New York in 2004.  First is the fallout from 9/11 and Bush\u2019s pledge to rebuild the city.  Second is the fading of social issues like abortion that had been boosting Democrats in suburban areas.  Third, Bush, like Bloomberg, has a flair for wooing Latinos \u2013 the swing group that arguably elected Bloomberg.  And Bush\u2019s strong pro-Israel stance gives him a chance to make inroads among Jews, usually staunch Democrats.  Says Rep. Pete King (R-L.I.): \u201cI think Bush can win New York because he can put together the old Reagan coalition. He has really connected to construction workers and cops and firemen. They trust him. I hear it the sad way \u2013 at [9/11] wakes.\u201d"
