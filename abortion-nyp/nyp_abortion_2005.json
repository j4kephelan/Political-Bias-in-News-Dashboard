    "2005 - 2730": "Mob rat Michael \u201cMikey Scars\u201d DiLeonardo testified yesterday that he was a cash machine for reputed Gambino boss Peter Gotti and nephew John \u201cJunior\u201d Gotti \u2013 personally delivering more than $2 million to them in construction kickbacks and other extortion scams.   In Manhattan federal court, DiLeonardo also fingered Peter Gotti as approving the attempted hit on Gambino snitch Salvatore \u201cSammy Bull\u201d Gravano.   DiLeonardo, a former Gambino captain, dropped the names of construction firms and eateries that were extorted \u2013 including the owner of the posh Cipriani restaurant.   Not even Hollywood was spared.   DiLeonardo said he was good friends with actor Mickey Rourke, and told jurors how the late Gambino boss John \u201cDapper Don\u201d Gotti persuaded Rourke not to appear in the film about the Irish gang called \u201cThe Westies\u201d because there was an unflattering mention of a Gambino soldier.   Rourke agreed not to appear in the movie, DiLeonardo said.   DiLeonardo said he directly gave kickbacks to Peter Gotti that he and his associates collected from construction firms from 1997 to 2002.   \u201cHow much did you put in Peter Gotti\u2019s hand?\u201d asked Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael McGovern.   \u201cOne point five million,\u201d DiLeonardo said.   He said he delivered another $250,000 in money from stock scams to Gotti.   DiLeonardo recalled doing business with Giuseppi Cipriani of Cipriani\u2019s restaurant.   He said Cipriani kicked back $125,000 to the Gambinos \u2013 via a check to another firm \u2013 to help settle a labor problem at the Rainbow Room in Rockefeller Center.   The Gambinos didn\u2019t solve the problem, but DiLeonardo said they were able to stop the restaurant workers union from picketing outside the eatery during Harry Cipriani\u2019s birthday.   Interstate Construction, which got the contract to help cover trash at the Fresh Kills landfill, also kicked back $25,000 to the Gambinos to avoid having a Teamsters foreman on the job.   DiLeonardo recalled meeting with Peter Gotti at London Lenny\u2019s fish restaurant in Queens in the spring of 2002 \u2013 just months after the plot to kill Gravano was foiled because Gravano was arrested on drug charges.   After the meal, DiLeonardo said he and Gotti walked outside when the alleged Gambino boss started ranting about the $70,000 wasted on the aborted Gravano hit.   His co-defendant Thomas \u201cHuck\u201d Carbonaro and sidekick Salvatore \u201cFat Sal\u201d Mangiavillano scouted out Gravano\u2019s digs in Arizona, DiLeonardo said.   DiLeonardo said Gotti was so teed off that he questioned whether the two even traveled to Arizona.   DiLeonardo said Gambino soldier Ed Garafola, a brother-in-law of Gravano, told him that Peter Gotti approved the plan to whack Gravano after he left the witness-protection program. ",
    "2005 - 2462": "DID Rudy Giuliani do himself any damage because of his enthusiastic advocacy of Bernard Kerik\u2019s flame-out nomination to head the nation\u2019s homeland-security effort?   Since Rudy is leading in some polls about who ought to be the Republican presidential nominee in 2008, will he have some explaining to do to GOP voters about Kerik\u2019s astonishingly abrupt demise?   The short answers: No and no.   Look, by the time voters have to make decisions about George W. Bush\u2019s successor, the words \u201cBernie Kerik\u201d will be the answer to a trivia question that even Ken Jennings might not be able to get right.   Rudy has many more substantial hurdles to overcome if he wants to be the GOP candidate \u2013 like his stances on abortion, gay rights and gun ownership.   Dealing with those blue-state liabilities in a red-state, red-meat Republican primary will be the challenge for him. His role as Bernie Kerik\u2019s patron won\u2019t even be a footnote to a footnote in history.   That\u2019s as it should be. No rational person could blame Rudy for Kerik\u2019s nanny problems, or for some of the other personal financial controversies swirling around Kerik this weekend.   Kerik is a grown-up, and he\u2019s responsible for his own decisions and his own actions. He developed an independent relationship with Bush and the president\u2019s men over the past two years, and was considered a valuable campaign surrogate.   The nomination wasn\u2019t some kind of gift to Rudy. It was a reward for Kerik himself. Now more than ever, the president wants people he likes and trusts in key cabinet positions \u2013 and Kerik would have been one of those guys.   He may have been foolish to accept the nomination from Bush in the first place, given his troubles, but Kerik did accept responsibility for the mistake with appropriate humility and honesty.   \u201cI owe the president an enormous amount of gratitude for this consideration,\u201d Kerik told The Associated Press. \u201cI owe him a great apology that this may have caused him and his administration a big distraction.\u201d   Right you are, Bernie, on both counts.   As for Rudy, he will continue to be an astonishingly popular figure in Republican circles \u2013 and he will continue to be the first name on everybody\u2019s lips for whatever senior Cabinet post comes open, as he was throughout November.   He\u2019s not going to be a Cabinet official. He\u2019s got too much else to do over the next few years to ready himself for the big 2008 run.   The Kerik fiasco isn\u2019t even a bump on the road.

    "2005 - 1177": "Murdered mother-to-be Bobbie Jo Stinnett is the latest victim of a disturbing nationwide trend \u2013 the killing of pregnant women or new moms \u2013 which has left a 1,367 women dead since 1990, The Washington Post reports today.   The paper conducted a yearlong investigation of death records from all 50 states to compile the number.   Most states don\u2019t have reliable systems to track the number of pregnant or postpartum women slain; 13 don\u2019t have any systems in place at all.   But based on the information the paper was able to examine, murders cut across all racial and ethnic groups and happened everywhere from small towns to urban neighborhoods.   Most were slain at home, and 67 percent were killed by firearms.   Most were killed by men they knew \u2013 boyfriends, husbands and lovers.   More than 100 of the victims were teens. Many already had children.   So what motivates these men to kill?   \u201cIf the woman doesn\u2019t want the baby, she can get an abortion,\u201d said Pat Brown, a criminal profiler based in Minneapolis. \u201cIf the guy doesn\u2019t want it, he can\u2019t do a damn thing about it. He is stuck with a child for the rest of his life.\u201d   \u201cIf she goes away, the problem goes away.\u201d",
    "2005 - 2915": " Hollywood tough guy Robert Blake tried to pull off the acting job of a lifetime after murdering the wife he hated \u2013 but his lousy performance gave him up, a Los Angeles prosecutor charged yesterday.   \u201cHe was more traumatized than he anticipated, because killing someone in real life is a whole lot different than in the movies,\u201d Deputy DA Shellie Samuels told rapt jurors during opening arguments in the slay case targeting the \u201cIn Cold Blood\u201d star.   \u201cHis acting ability failed him that night because he didn\u2019t know he\u2019d be so freaked out.\u201d   Prosecutors are arguing that the 71-year-old actor killed his 44-year-old wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, outside the couple\u2019s favorite Studio City restaurant in May 2001 to gain control of their baby daughter, Rosie.   Cops claim that Blake first tried to hire two stunt men to do his dirty work. But after having been rebuffed, the actor opted to pull the trigger himself, they say.   \u201cThis was not a marriage made in heaven,\u201d Samuels said.   \u201cThe evidence will show that the defendant thought that Bonny\u2019s family . . . were low-life trailer trash that all made their living working for Bonny in her illegal schemes to scam money,\u201d Samuels said, referring to Bakley\u2019s life as a grifter who preyed on lonely men.   Samuels said that when Bakley became pregnant, Blake tried to push her to get an abortion.   Ironically, though, Blake wound up killing Bakley so that he could keep the baby, Samuels charged. She said he was obsessed with the baby and feared that her mother would later turn her into a prostitute.   The former \u201cBaretta\u201d star \u2013 whose trademark black-dyed hair has turned stark white in jail \u2013 donned a dark suit, blue shirt and dark tie for court. His face looking drawn, he stared blankly at the jury of seven men and five women as Samuels plotted out the prosecution\u2019s case.   Blake has said he left his wife in their car when he ran back into the trendy Vitello\u2019s eatery to retrieve a gun he carried for protection. When he returned, he says, he found her mortally shot, likely by one of the many men she had cheated out of money.   The murder weapon was found in a trash can near the scene, but could not be linked to Blake.   Still, Samuels said Blake was clearly ruffled when talking with authorities during their probe.   \u201cHe was not able to compose himself. No one could recall him going back to the restaurant,\u201d she said.   But the actor\u2019s lawyer, M. Gerald Schwartzbach, hinted that the defense would build its case around whether Blake did the actual shooting \u2013 as the charges against him state.   \u201cThere is no evidence \u2013 not direct or circumstantial \u2013 that [Robert Blake] personally shot Bonnie Bakley, and that is the crime with which he is charged,\u201d the lawyer told the jury.   \u201cIt is true he was over the moon about that child, and he continues to be so,\u201d Schwartzbach said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a crime.\u201d   Blake faces up to life in prison if convicted.

    "2005 - 1323": "Manhattan prosecutors are becoming a royal pain for a certain fake princess.   On the brink of pleading guilty to a bizarre insurance scam \u2013 in which she allegedly pretended to be a mugged Saudi princess \u2013 tiara-toting commoner Antoinette Millard is facing the prospect of still more criminal charges.   The no-jail deal fell through because the DA\u2019s office is now considering bringing additional charges for the $950,000 Millard racked up on her American Express \u201cCenturion\u201d card while posing as a big-bucks blueblood.   At the bad news, the pale and frail-looking 40-year-old former banker cried silently in her fur-trimmed pink coat.   Under the aborted deal, Millard would have pleaded guilty to insurance fraud for telling Chubb Insurance that she\u2019d been mugged on Madison Avenue out of $260,000 in royal jewels she\u2019d insured a day earlier.   Millard would have stayed out of jail by checking herself into a psychiatric facility for treatment of her manic depression.   Now, she must wait for the DA to decide on whether to prosecute the AmEx case.   Millard started pretending to be \u201cPrincess Antoinette\u201d last year \u2013 even showing up in a tiara and smiling for paparazzi at fashion functions. In fact, she was a divorced former assistant VP at Brown Brothers Harriman who lived in a one-bedroom on the Upper East Side.",
    "2005 - 2490": " WASHINGTON \u2013 New Yorkers flushed nearly $40 million down the drain backing John Kerry\u2019s failed presidential quest and the aborted bids of Howard Dean, Wesley Clark and other White House wannabes.   Their neighbors who supported President Bush are getting a lot more bang for their 12 million bucks.   All told, Empire State residents opened their wallets at a record rate for the 2004 race for the White House, forking over nearly $52 million \u2013 the most of any state except California, according to the nonpartisan money-tracker TRKC Inc.   The state broke more than 2-to-1 for Kerry over Bush, pumping $27.8 million into his campaign coffers.   The cash flowing from New York made it the second most lucrative state for stumping presidential candidates, trailing only the $72.6 million forked over by California denizens.   New Jersey was the eighth most generous state, donating $15.5 million to White House hopefuls \u2013 including $5.9 million to Bush and $6.5 million for Kerry.   Of the top 10 most fertile political-money states, seven went for Kerry on Election Day \u2013 with Texas, Florida and Virginia going for Bush.   And only one top state \u2013 Pennsylvania \u2013 didn\u2019t vote with its wallet. Bush trumped Kerry in fund-raising in the Keystone State, yet Kerry scooped up the vote at the polls.   New York City, Los Angeles, Boston and Washington were Kerry\u2019s money havens, according to fundrace.org, while Houston, Dallas and Atlanta were Bush\u2019s most generous hubs.   In New York City, the most politically generous residents for the 2004 campaign could be found on the Upper East Side, between East 60th and East 80th streets, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.   Residents there forked over $20.6 million to the presidential players, up more than $2.5 million from 2000.   Radio City Music Hall was the site of one of Kerry\u2019s most profitable fund-raisers this past summer \u2013 but he came to regret what happened there.   Comedian Whoopi Goldberg delivered an X-rated anti-Bush rant to the crowd of Hollywood hotshots \u2013 prompting Kerry to say the liberal celebs represented mainstream America.   \u2014-  Big wallets  How much states gave in the presidential race:  State \u2014 Total donation \u2014 Per capita donation  1.

    "2005 - 1359": "A hard-nosed German cardinal known as the \u201cPanzerkardinal\u201d has re-emerged as a front-runner to become the next pope, according to a new report.   Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, whose role of point man for Pope John Paul II\u2019s conservative moral policy has made him a target of liberal Catholics, had been considered out of the running to succeed the pontiff because of his views and blunt manner.   But sources in Rome quoted by Time magazine say that the 77-year-old Ratzinger now is among the top contenders.   \u201cThe Ratzinger solution is definitely on,\u201d said a Vatican insider quoted by Time, which noted that the speculation is occurring despite there being no indications that John Paul\u2019s health has worsened.   The solution being sought by some at the Vatican, according to the magazine, is to see that the next pope is a \u201ctransitional\u201d figure, one who will spend a just few years on the throne of St. Peter after John Paul II.   Ratzinger has improved his odds to fit that bill with some diplomatic handling of hot-button issues such as Islamic fundamentalism and the question of whether Catholic political candidates in the U.S. who support abortion rights should be denied Holy Communion, Time reported.   But any change could still be decided by the sands of time. John Paul has publicly ruled out being the first pope in 800 years to retire voluntarily. "
