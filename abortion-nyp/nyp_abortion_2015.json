    "2015 - 6980": "Something extraordinary happened on Election Day. Voters in the state of Utah elected Mia Love, the Brooklyn-born daughter of Haitian immigrants, to serve in the US House of Representatives.The fact that Love, 38, is black is little cause for comment. What\u2019s of note is that a fiscal conservative who graduated from Connecticut\u2019s\u00a0University of Hartford, supports gun rights, opposes a woman\u2019s right to choose abortion, and wants to repeal ObamaCare has defeated a male Democrat to become the first black Republican woman \u2014 ever \u2014 to be elected to Congress. That might be a good reason to stand up and take notice.Finally! Diversity in government.\u201cMy parents immigrated to the US with 10 dollars in their pocket, believing that the America they had heard about really did exist,\u2019\u2019 Love said in a speech at the Republican National Convention in 2012. \u201cWhen times got tough, they didn\u2019t look to Washington, they looked within.\u2019\u2019This election saw a huge number of voters looking within and rejecting the leftist, pro-big-government policies of President Obama. Soon, more than 100 women, Republican and Democratic, will be serving in the House and Senate, a new record. And still, that has not stopped the usual feminist suspects from whining that their sisters in estrogen have not gained substantial numbers of elective offices. I think I know why.Republican women \u2014 ladies who cannot be counted on to support the standard, liberal political agenda \u2014 have made the greatest inroads this time around. Call it The Year of the Republican Woman. Consider:In New York, Republican Elise Stefanik, a Harvard grad and pro-small-business leader who helped run the upstate plywood company founded by her family, won the race for the state\u2019s 21st Congressional District, beating her male Democratic challenger. And at age 30, the incoming House member is the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. That\u2019s an amazing feat for a woman whose greatest struggle will be to improve the often-hostile climate for business owners.She told The Post before the election that said she feels honored \u201cto have added an additional crack in the glass ceiling.\u201dRepublican Joni Ernst, 44, became the first woman to represent Iowa in the US Senate after beating her Democratic challenger, a guy. Ernst serves in her state\u2019s Army National Guard and was a company commander in Iraq in 2003. She also grew up on a farm castrating pigs \u2014 she cried in a TV commercial, \u201cWashington is full of big spenders. Let\u2019s make \u2019em squeal.\u2019\u2019After serving seven terms as a Republican House member, Shelley Moore Capito, 60, holds the distinction of being the first woman ever elected to the US Senate from her home state, West Virginia. In Virginia, Republican Barbara Comstock, 55, won a hotly contested House seat, defeating her male Democratic opponent and keeping the seat for the GOP.\u201cThis is not the triumph of women or women\u2019s politics. This is the triumph of the politics of ideas,\u2019\u2019 Lisa Schiffren, senior fellow of the conservative think tank the Independent Women\u2019s Forum, told me.Women are \u201cgetting elected because of their policies, not because of gender or race or identity politics.\u2019\u2019Readers know that I don\u2019t agree with the entire right-wing agenda, particularly when it comes to abortion rights, which I support. But conservative women have for too long been maligned by the left as closet woman-haters at best, right-wing lunatics at worst \u2014 a kind of bigotry that should make us all cry foul.\u201cThe contention is that a Republican is going to take away your right to abortion and contraception,\u2019\u2019 said Schiffren. \u201cThat\u2019s just a joke.\u201cWomen want jobs \u2014 for themselves, for their daughters, their sons and husbands,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cVoters understand that the economy, immigration, foreign policy matter.\u2019\u2019An 18-year-old woman, Saira Blair, a university freshman and a Republican, was elected to the House of Delegates, one of West Virginia\u2019s two state legislative bodies, defeating her male Democratic opponent. When she\u2019s sworn into office, she\u2019ll become the youngest lawmaker in the country. Blair is pro-gun rights and against abortion. But she \u201ccampaigned on a pledge to work to reduce certain taxes on business,\u2019\u2019 according to The Wall Street Journal.Republican women are growing in number, power and influence. Get used to it.It was a good day for stoners. On Election Day, voters in Alaska, Oregon \u2014 and Washington, DC \u2014 approved measures allowing the recreational use of marijuana.While some lawmakers have signaled that they\u2019d likely work to block pot smoking and ingestion in the nation\u2019s capital, it\u2019s tempting to root for wacky weed. It might be just the ticket to get warring factions to work together in harmony.A pair of skinned goat heads joined together by twine were found hanging on a light pole at a busy intersection in Park Slope, Brooklyn, like an old pair of tennis shoes, upsetting animal-rights types and ordinary folks who\u2019d just eaten breakfast.Then a car-service worker knocked down the bloody remains and threw the heads in a garbage pail. Cops are investigating. Was this part of a Santer\u00eda ritual? Voodoo? Or was it a New York City-style prank?Whatever it was, it was gross.Superstar Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson got a major break.He\u2019d been indicted by a Texas grand jury on a felony charge of reckless or negligent injury to a child after beating his 4-year-old son in May with a wooden switch, leaving cuts and bruises all over the small boy\u2019s back, buttocks, legs, hands and one of his testicles.But prosecutors this week signed off on a sweet plea deal allowing Peterson, 29, to plead no contest to a misdemeanor charge of reckless assault. A judge did not order him to spend even a minute in jail.Oh, he\u2019ll have to serve probation, pay a $4,000 fine, complete \u201cparenting\u2019\u2019 classes and perform 80 hours of community service. That\u2019s a walk in the park compared with the up to two years in prison and $10,000 fine he had faced if convicted of felony child abuse.Now Daddy Dearest wants not only to reconnect with his son, whom he was barred from seeing, but wants to resume playing football, said his lawyer. Peterson\u2019s been on a paid leave of absence from the Vikings under a special exemption from the National Football League commissioner while his court case played out. A league spokesman would not say when or if he\u2019ll return to the gridiron. But I think you can count on it. Football is important.A child, not so much.She\u2019s one of Hollywood\u2019s highest-paid actresses, an Oscar winner and a filmmaker who serves as a globe-trotting humanitarian, a special envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. She\u2019s also a mother of six and is married to hunky movie star Brad Pitt, 50.Angelina Jolie, 39, has told Vanity Fair magazine that \u201cI am open\u2019\u2019 to the idea of pursuing politics. Why does she consider herself qualified to take the plunge? Then again, Jolie\u2019s bound to increase the hotness quotient in the halls of government.Run, Angie, run!",
    "2015 - 23887": "President Ronald Reagan secretly recorded some of his conversations with foreign leaders, discovered author William Doyle, who shared some of these never-heard tapes exclusively with The Post.\u201cUntil now, taping was thought to have stopped in the Nixon era. I discovered that was not the case,\u201d Doyle said.The recordings from the White House Situation Room include Reagan trying to convince an intractable Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to hold off the pullout of Israeli troops from Lebanon in 1983 until Lebanese forces can replace them; the president discussing the release of Western hostages in the Middle East with Pakistani President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, and a talk with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, the father of Syria\u2019s current dictator and the original \u201cButcher of Damascus\u201d\u2014 whom he kept waiting for over 13 minutes while he finished up a horseback ride at his California ranch.\u201cDamascus is saying hurry up, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Assad\u2019s frustrated translator says at one point before the conversation.Doyle said Reagan recorded many, but not all, of his phone calls with heads of state through the Situation Room switchboard, so that an accurate record could be kept of conversations that often included translators and bad connections.\u201cThere is no evidence that I have seen that Reagan audiotaped any other closed-door non-public White House business,\u201d said Doyle.The tapes \u2014 found in the Situation Room in response to 1987 congressional Iran-Contra inquiries \u2014 were routinely discarded or recorded over, but Doyle received them last week following a Freedom of Information Act request he made in 1996.\u201cThe White House told Congress they were not relevant to the inquiry, and the tapes stayed in the White House, classified and unheard by any outsiders, until they were labeled, boxed and sent to the Reagan Library, where they remained classified,\u201d said Doyle, co-author of \u201cNavy SEALS: Their Untold Story,\u201d a new book out this week, and co-producer of the companion PBS documentary special.Steve Branch, an audiovisual archivist at the Reagan Presidential Library in California, said the tapes are the first audio recordings of White House Situation Room telephone conversations the library has released to date.The five recordings, which Doyle said he selected because of their potential historical value, include two of Zia-ul-Haq \u2014 who died in a plane crash that was a suspected assassination in 1988 \u2014 who is exceedingly deferential to Reagan, repeatedly apologizing for potentially bothering him with the call about the Beirut hostage crisis of 1984. Reagan insists the hijackers not be appeased, \u201cbecause I think we would just see more hijackings then and more terrorism.\u201dIn another recording, Reagan profusely apologizes to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for not consulting with her before launching SEALs and other American forces into Grenada in October 1983.\u201cI guess it\u2019s the first thing we have done since I\u2019ve been president in which the secret was actually kept until it happened,\u201d he notes.Here are some excerpts from the Reagan tapes acquired by author William Doyle, who puts the calls in context for The Post:<a name=\"44fa290685ba5761e82774acf90f21a3-56757169-54652679\"></a>\n<iframe allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"wpcom-protected-iframe\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"20\" id=\"wpcom-iframe-44fa290685ba5761e82774acf90f21a3-56757169-54652679\" scrolling=\"yes\" src=\"https://embeds.nypost.com/protected-iframe/44fa290685ba5761e82774acf90f21a3-56757169-54652679\" width=\"100%\">\n</iframe>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t( function() {\n\t\t\tvar func = function() {\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-44fa290685ba5761e82774acf90f21a3-56757169-54652679')\n\t\t\t\tif ( iframe ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe.onload = function() {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.contentWindow.postMessage( {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'msg_type': 'poll_size',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'frame_id': 'wpcom-iframe-44fa290685ba5761e82774acf90f21a3-56757169-54652679'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}, \"https:\\/\\/embeds.nypost.com\" );\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t// Autosize iframe\n\t\t\t\tvar funcSizeResponse = function( e ) {\n\n\t\t\t\t\tvar origin = document.createElement( 'a' );\n\t\t\t\t\torigin.href = e.origin;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message origin\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'embeds.nypost.com' !== origin.host )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message is in a format we expect\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'object' !== typeof e.data || undefined === e.data.msg_type )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\tswitch ( e.data.msg_type ) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcase 'poll_size:response':\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById( e.data._request.frame_id );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.width )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.width = '100%';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.height )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.height = parseInt( e.data.height );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefault:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\tif ( 'function' === typeof window.addEventListener ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.addEventListener( 'message', funcSizeResponse, false );\n\t\t\t\t} else if ( 'function' === typeof window.attachEvent ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.attachEvent( 'onmessage', funcSizeResponse );\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tif (document.readyState === 'complete') { func.apply(); /* compat for infinite scroll */ }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.addEventListener ) { document.addEventListener( 'DOMContentLoaded', func, false ); }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.attachEvent ) { document.attachEvent( 'onreadystatechange', func ); }\n\t\t} )();\n\t\t</script>\nA deeply apologetic Reagan pours on the charm on Oct. 26, 1983 as he tries to assuage the anger of the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who he knows is furious that he is invading Grenada without having consulted with her first. \u201cIt is a remarkable, secret presidential call, as Reagan is in the middle of a major presidential crisis, thousands of US troops are in motion into combat and he is talking without a script,\u201d Doyle says.

I was awakened at 3 in the morning, supposedly on a golfing vacation down in Georgia. And was there with the secretary of state [George Shultz], so we met in pajamas out in the living room of our suite because of this urgent plea from the Organization of East Caribbean States pleading with us to support them in this thing in Grenada.We immediately got a group going back here in Washington, which we shortly joined, on planning and so forth. It was literally a matter of hours. We were greatly concerned, because of a problem here \u2014 and not at your end at all \u2014 but here. We\u2019ve had a nagging problem of a loose source, a leak, here. At the same time we had immediate surveillance \u2014 as well as we could without their knowing it was happening \u2014 on Cuba to make sure that we could get ahead of them if they were moving and indeed, they were making some tentative moves. They sent some kind of command personnel into the island there.Incidentally, let me tell you that we were being so careful here that we didn\u2019t even give a firm answer to the Caribbean States. We told them that we were planning, but we were so afraid of this source and what it would do; it could almost abort a mission, with the lives that could have endangered.When word came of your concerns \u2014 by the time I got it \u2014 the zero hour had passed, and our forces were on their way. And of course the time difference made it later in the day when you learned of it. For us over here it was only 5:30 in the morning when they finally landed and at last we could talk plainly. But I want you to know it was no feeling on our part of lack of confidence at your end. It\u2019s at our end.And so, I guess it\u2019s the first thing we have done since I\u2019ve been president in which the secret was actually kept until it happened. But our military and the planning only had \u2014 I really have to call it a matter of hours \u2014 to put this together. I think they did a magnificent job. Your governor general [Sir Paul Scoon] there, we have him safe, and his wife. That was one of our primary goals was to immediately sequester him for his safety. So he is safe in our hands down there.<strong>Thatcher:</strong> I know about sensitivity, because of the Falklands. That\u2019s why I would not speak for very long even on the secret telephone to you. Because even that can be broken. I\u2019m very much aware of sensitivities. The action is underway now and we just hope it will be successful.<em>(Later)</em><br/>\n<strong>Reagan: </strong>I tell ya, those people on those other islands, they\u2019re pretty remarkable. We\u2019ve had here, when I made the announcement to the press here, that OK they\u2019re on shore and D-Day has happened. And I had with me, Prime Minister Charles.<strong>Thatcher: </strong>I know her. She\u2019s a wonderful person.<strong>Reagan:</strong> She certainly is. She\u2019s captured our city by storm. She\u2019s right up on the Hill meeting with some of our Congress right now. And then, Adams, from Barbados, we are getting him up here. We\u2019ve got both of them on some of our television shows so they can talk to the people. We are getting him on, we\u2019ve had her on. He\u2019s a remarkable man also.<strong>Thatcher:</strong> He\u2019s a very remarkable man. He is a very cultured man and very wise. He\u2019s been in politics a long time.<strong>Reagan: </strong>Yes. You know she doesn\u2019t have an army. She did away with an army completely. She has a police force. She told me that her constables in her police force were coming in from out in the country and asking her if they couldn\u2019t go with the forces over there.<strong>Thatcher: </strong>They wanted to help.<strong>Reagan:</strong> They all feel \u2014 and dating from the days when they were under the Crown \u2014 she used the expression: kith and kin. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s one of our expressions or one of yours.<strong>Thatcher:</strong> It\u2019s one of ours.<strong>Reagan:</strong> Well, we still use it here. We still have the heritage. She used that several times to describe their feelings. They have no feeling of the people on the other islands being foreigners. They still think of themselves as all one group. We want to put them out ahead in helping with the restoration of a government, so there will be no taint of big old Uncle Sam trying to impose a government on them.<strong>Thatcher:</strong> There is a lot of work to do yet, Ron.<strong>Reagan:</strong> Oh, yes.<em>(Later)</em><br/>\n<strong>Thatcher: </strong>I must return to this debate in the House. It is a bit tricky.<strong>Reagan: </strong>All right. Go get \u2019em.

Well, we must do that in a way that does not make the hijackers think that they have won their goal, because I think we would just see more hijackings then and more terrorism. But we believe that if they will return ours, and then I think the Israelis are prepared to also to deliver theirs.

It shows Reagan trying to maneuver the explosive chess pieces of a Mideast crisis that included the US Navy SEALs as part of multinational peacekeeping force; the Israeli, Lebanese and Syrian armies; the PLO; and multiple militias and terrorist factions.Begin can\u2019t bring himself to say no to Reagan \u2014 and instead will have his defense minister tell the Americans that they are pulling out.\u201cIt is also an astonishing recording as it captures a moment in the death of Menachem Begin\u2019s political career. He was deeply depressed over the disastrous war in Lebanon and by the death the previous year of his beloved wife. He was also plagued with heart trouble and other health problems.

He came back from Lebanon. I know that the evacuation had to start tonight . . .I will get in touch with our defense minister . . . any minute . . . and then I\u2019ll get in touch with you.

    "2015 - 1675": "ANKARA, Turkey \u2014 Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan set off a new controversy Monday, declaring that women are not equal to men and accusing feminists of not understanding the special status that Islam confers on mothers.Addressing a meeting in Istanbul on women and justice, Erdogan said men and women are created differently, that women cannot be expected to undertake the same work as men, and that mothers enjoy a high position that only they can reach.\u201cYou cannot put women and men on an equal footing,\u201d Erdogan said. \u201cIt is against nature.

    "2015 - 4413": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. \u2014 NASA\u2019s new Orion spacecraft streaked toward orbit Friday on a high-stakes test flight meant to usher in a new era of human exploration leading ultimately to Mars.The unmanned orbital journey began with a sunrise liftoff witnessed by thousands of NASA guests eager to watch what the agency called \u201chistory in the making.\u201d\u201cThe star of the day is Orion,\u201d said NASA Administrator Charles Bolden Jr., back for the second morning in a row. He called it \u201cDay One of the Mars era.\u201dOrion\u2019s debut will be brief \u2014 just 4\u00bd hours from launch to splashdown, with two orbits of Earth. But for the first time in 42 years, NASA is sending a spacecraft built for humans farther than a couple hundred miles from Earth. The previous time was the Apollo 17 moon shot.And it\u2019s NASA\u2019s first new vehicle for space travel since the shuttle.Friday\u2019s flight test brings NASA \u201cone step closer\u201d to putting humans aboard Orion, Bolden said just before liftoff.Sluggish rocket valves and wind halted Thursday\u2019s launch attempt. Everything went NASA\u2019s way Friday, and the Delta IV rocket blasted off with Orion as dawn broke.NASA was aiming for a peak altitude of 3,600 miles on Orion\u2019s second lap around the planet, in order to give the capsule the necessary momentum for a scorchingly high-speed re-entry over the Pacific. Engineers want to see how the heat shield \u2014 the largest of its kind ever built \u2014 holds up when Orion comes back through the atmosphere traveling at 20,000 mph and enduring 4,000 degrees.The atmosphere at Kennedy Space Center was reminiscent of the shuttle-flying days. After more than three years since the last shuttle flight, NASA reveled in all the attention.Roads appeared to be less jammed before dawn for the second try, and NASA was uncertain how many of the estimated 27,000 invited guests returned. Nonetheless, the press site remained jammed, hotels packed and the excitement level high. \u201cIt\u2019s a big day for the world, for people who know and like space,\u201d Bolden said, observing the crowds.In Houston, NASA\u2019s Mission Control took over the entire operation once Orion was aloft. The flight program was loaded into Orion\u2019s computers well in advance, allowing the spacecraft to fly essentially on autopilot. Flight controllers \u2014 all shuttle veterans \u2014 could intervene in the event of an emergency breakdown.And in the Pacific off the Mexican Baja coast, Navy ships waited for Orion\u2019s return.The spacecraft is rigged with 1,200 sensors to gauge everything from heat to vibration to radiation. At 11 feet tall with a 16\u00bd-foot base, Orion is bigger than the old-time Apollo capsules and, obviously, more advanced.NASA deliberately kept astronauts off this first Orion.Managers want to test the riskiest parts of the spacecraft \u2014 the heat shield, parachutes and various jettisoning components \u2014 before committing to a crew. In addition, on-board computers were going to endure the high-radiation Van Allen belts; engineers wondered whether they might falter.Lockheed Martin Corp. already has begun work on a second Orion, and plans to eventually build a fleet of the capsules. The earliest that astronauts might fly on an Orion is 2021. An asteroid redirected to lunar orbit is intended for the first stop in the 2020s, followed by Mars in the 2030s.The company handled the $370 million test flight for NASA from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, opting for the Delta IV rocket this time given its heft. It\u2019s the most powerful unmanned rocket in the U.S. right now. The entire rocket and capsule, topped by a launch abort tower, stretched 242 feet and weighed 1.6 million pounds \u2014 an \u201cincredible monster,\u201d according to Bolden.To push Orion farther out on future flights, NASA is developing a megarocket known as Space Launch System or SLS. The first Orion-SLS combo will fly around 2018, again without a crew to shake out the rocket.NASA\u2019s last trip beyond low-Earth orbit in a vessel built for people was the three-man Apollo 17 in December 1972. Orion will be capable of carrying four astronauts on long hauls and as many as six on three-week hikes.Dozens of astronauts, present and past, gathered at Kennedy for the historic send-off. One of them \u2014 Bolden \u2014 now leads NASA.He called Mars \u201cthe ultimate destination of this generation,\u201d but said his three young granddaughters think otherwise, telling him, \u201cDon\u2019t get hung up on Mars because there are other places to go once we get there.\u201d",
    "2015 - 5835": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Congress cleared a $1.1 trillion spending bill for President Barack Obama\u2019s signature late Saturday night after a day of Senate intrigue capped by a failed, largely symbolic Republican challenge to the administration\u2019s new immigration policy.The vote was 56-40 in favor of the measure, which funds nearly the entire government through the Sept. 30 end of the fiscal year. It also charts a new course for selected shaky pension plans covering more than 1 million retirees, including the possibility of benefit cuts.The Senate passed the bill on a day Democrats launched a drive to confirm two dozen of Obama\u2019s stalled nominees to the federal bench and administration posts, before their majority expires at year\u2019s end.Several Republicans blamed tea party-backed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for giving the outgoing majority party an opportunity to seek approval for presidential appointees, including some that are long-stalled.It was Cruz who pushed the Senate to cast its first vote on the administration\u2019s policy of suspending the threat of deportation for an estimated four million immigrants living in the country illegally. He lost his attempt Saturday night, 74-22, although Republican leaders have vowed to bring the issue back after the party takes control of the Senate in January.\u201cIf you believe President Obama\u2019s amnesty is unconstitutional, vote yes. If you believe President Obama\u2019s amnesty is consistent with the Constitution, vote no,\u201d he said.Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid rebutted instantly, saying Cruz was \u201cwrong, wrong, wrong on several counts,\u201d and even Republicans who oppose Obama\u2019s policy abandoned the Texan.The spending bill, which cleared the House on Thursday, was the main item left on Congress\u2019 year-end agenda, and exposed fissures within both political parties in both houses.It faced opposition from Democratic liberals upset about the repeal of a banking regulation and Republican conservatives unhappy that it failed to challenge Obama\u2019s immigration moves.While the legislation assures funding for nearly the entire government until next fall, it made an exception of the Department of Homeland Security. Money for the agency will run out on Feb. 27, when Republicans intend to try and force the president to roll back an immigration policy that removes the threat of deportation from millions of immigrants living in the United States illegally.The legislation locks in spending levels negotiated in recent years between Republicans and Democrats, and includes a number of provisions that reflect the priorities of one party or the other, from the environment to abortion to the legalization of marijuana in the District of Columbia.One, which drew vehement objections from the Democrats, would repeal a regulation imposed on banks in the wake of the near economic collapse of 2008. Critics called it a bailout for large financial institutions, but more than 70 House Democrats voted for it previously, and Obama made clear he didn\u2019t view it as a deal-killer.The pension provision was a bipartisan agreement that opens the door for the first time to benefit cuts for current retirees covered by multi-employer funds in shaky financial condition.Supporters said it would protect retirement income to the maximum extent possible without also endangering the solvency of the government fund that guarantees multi-employer plans. Critics said it posed a threat to the pension recipients, and that it could also become a precedent for other pensioners.Immigration was at the heart of the day\u2019s events in the Senate.Cruz seized on the issue late Friday night when he tried to challenge the bill. That led swiftly to the unraveling of an informal bipartisan agreement to give the Senate the weekend off, with a vote on final passage of the bill deferred until early this coming week.That, in turn, led Reid, D-Nev., to call an all-day Senate session devoted almost exclusively to beginning time-consuming work on confirmation for 13 judicial appointees and 11 nominees to administration posts.The list included Carolyn Colvin to head the Social Security Administration and Vivek Murthy as surgeon general.As the day wore on, senators were forced to spend hour after hour on the Senate floor to cast their votes. One, Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., sat at her desk quietly for awhile reading a book.By evening, cocktail hour in the East, strains of Christmas carols could be heard from behind the closed doors of rooms that surround the chamber.Republicans tried to slow the nomination proceedings, but several voiced unhappiness with Cruz, a potential presidential candidate in 2016.\u201cI\u2019ve seen this movie before, and I wouldn\u2019t pay money to see it again,\u201d said Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., recalling Cruz\u2019 leading role a year ago in events precipitating a 16-day partial government shutdown that briefly sent GOP poll ratings plummeting.Cruz, in turn, blamed Reid, saying his \u201clast act as majority leader is to, once again, act as an enabler\u201d for the president by blocking a vote on Obama\u2019s policy that envisions work visas for an estimated 5 million immigrants living in the country illegally.Reid blamed a \u201csmall group of Senate Republicans\u201d for the turn of events.Asked if Cruz had created an opening for the Democrats, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah said, \u201cI wish you hadn\u2019t pointed that out.\u201dHatch added, \u201cYou should have an end goal in sight if you\u2019re going to do these types of things and I don\u2019t see an end goal other than irritating a lot of people.\u201dThe GOP leader, Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, made no public comment on the events, even though Cruz suggested Friday night McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, should not be entirely trusted to keep their pledge to challenge Obama\u2019s immigration policy.\u201cWe will learn soon enough if those statements are genuine and sincere,\u201d Cruz said.",

She has been widely criticized, for instance, for accepting a reported $400,000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs last year.Warren\u2019s high-profile budget move failed late Saturday, but dramatically raised her standing among the Democrats\u2019 left-of-center party base. It couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time for Clinton.MoveOn.org is gearing up to spend $1 million on an effort to \u201cdraft\u2019\u2019 Warren into the 2016 presidential race and, just a few days ago, more than 300 of President Obama\u2019s former campaign staffers and organizers released a letter urging Warren to run.\u201cI didn\u2019t used to think that Warren would be a threat to Hillary, but I have to say, given the events of the last several days, I\u2019m starting to worry that she really is,\u2019\u2019 added another prominent Democrat.Rep. Chris Gibson of Kinderhook, who won re-election by a crushing 30 percentage points over Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes\u2019 husband, despite being outspent by nearly 3-to-1, is moving to rebuild the state\u2019s sclerotic Republican Party \u2014 and appears to be eyeing the race for governor in 2018.\u201cWe have to have a party that can compete in this state, that can get into the marketplace of ideas with candidates of vision and integrity, and that has the ability to rally people,\u2019\u2019 Gibson, a forceful, 50-year-old Gulf War veteran and Cornell Ph.D., told The Post.Gibson is a self-described fiscal conservative and gun-rights backer who also favors abortion rights and, while it takes him five minutes of abstract explaining to say, appears to back gay marriage.He argues that his lopsided victory over Sean Eldridge in a district that backed Obama two years ago could be a model for future Republican races statewide.\u201cWhat my race shows is that Republicans, through competence and ability, can bring people together, can rise above the traditional partisan divide,\u2019\u2019 Gibson said.He added that Mayor Bill de\u2009Blasio\u2019s left-of-center policies, along with Gov.

A crowd, estimated by the Vatican to number more than 80,000 Romans, tourists and pilgrims, filled St. Peter\u2019s Square for the \u201cUrbi et Orbi\u201d message (Latin for \u201cto the city and to the world\u201d).\u201cTruly there are so many tears this Christmas,\u201d said Francis, looking solemn and smiling little, in contrast to his often jocular demeanor when addressing crowds.He lamented that many children are \u201cmade objects of trade and trafficking\u201d or forced to become soldiers, as well as those never born because of abortion.\u201cI think also of those infants massacred in bomb attacks, also those where the Son of God was born,\u201d said Francis, referring to the Middle East.<figure class=\"wp-caption alignright\" id=\"attachment_8404661\"><a class=\"\" href=\"https://vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/12/536370291.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-8404661\" height=\"200\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"https://vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/12/536370291.jpg?w=300\" srcset=\"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/12/536370291.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=600 600w, https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/12/536370291.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=450 450w, https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/12/536370291.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=300 300w, https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/12/536370291.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=150 150w, https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/12/536370291.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all 1024w\" width=\"300\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"credit\">AFP</span></figcaption></figure>Francis decried the persecution of ancient Christian communities in Iraq and Syria, along with those from other ethnic and religious groups.\u201cMay Christmas bring them hope,\u201d he said.Referring to refugees and exiles, he prayed: \u201cMay indifference be changed into closeness, and rejection into hospitality.\u201d He expressed hope they\u2019d receive humanitarian help to withstand the \u201crigors of winter, return to their countries and live with dignity.\u201dThe pope also thanked those courageously helping people infected with Ebola in Africa.In his litany of the world\u2019s troubled places, he denounced hostage-taking in Nigeria, and hoped that reconciliation would prevail over \u201chatred and violence\u201d in Ukraine, where pro-Russian rebels have been fighting against government forces in the east of that country.While much of his message concerned poor countries, Francis had harsh words for some in affluent nations. He prayed for an end to the hardened hearts \u201cof so many men and women immersed in worldliness and indifference, the globalization of indifference.\u201dChristmas joy will only be realized when weapons are transformed \u201cinto ploughshares, destruction into creativity, hatred into love and tenderness,\u201d Francis concluded before giving the crowd his blessing.About an hour after the pope went inside, a protester from the Femen activist group bared her chest and snatched the statue of Baby Jesus in the life-sized Nativity scene at the center of the square, while thousands of visitors were strolling across the space. A gendarme from the Vatican\u2019s security forces hustled away the woman, after she was covered with a coat.",
    "2015 - 1459": "A topless feminist activist let it all hang out in St. Peter\u2019s Square on Christmas Day, as she ripped off her shirt and tried to steal a statue of the Christ Child from a manger scene. The brazen blonde \u2014 a member of the radical group Femen \u2014 had \u201cGod Is Woman\u201d scrawled on her chest as she stormed the nativity scene in full view of thousands of pilgrims after Pope Francis\u2019 Christmas message at St. Peter\u2019s Basilica.A video of the X-rated Xmas stunt captured the sinful stunner squeezing through a fence, bolting toward the display and grabbing Baby Jesus.She then held the statue aloft and shouted slogans as a cape-wearing lawman chased her down and grabbed her.The officer seemed as interested in covering her up as in arresting her \u2014 and he quickly tried wrapping her in his long cloak.Femen said on its Web site that the pro-choice streaker \u201ckidnapped a newborn baby in Vatican\u201d as part of the group\u2019s \u201cMassacre of the Innocents\u201d campaign against the church\u2019s teachings on women\u2019s issues.\u201cThe maniacal desire to control women\u2019s fertility is a common trait of many religions,\u201d the site said. \u201cAbortion is sacred!\u201dThe group was founded in Ukraine in 2008 to protest the former pro-Kremlin regime, sex tourism and prostitution.
