The local bishop said he backed the decision that affirms the church\u2019s anti-abortion teachings.The decision drew fierce backlash from alumnae who threatened to stop donating to the school and instead donate to the pro-abortion rights group.The school had no additional comment.",
    "2018 - 5098": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 Former presidential hopeful Mitt Romney is running for a Utah Senate seat, officially launching his political comeback attempt Friday by praising his adopted home state as a model for an acrimonious national government in Washington.Having been one of the Republican Party\u2019s <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2016/02/25/trump-calls-out-romney-for-playing-a-tough-guy/\">fiercest internal critics of President Donald Trump</a>, Romney didn\u2019t mention the administration or Trump himself in a campaign announcement posted online. The closest allusion to Trump was Romney noting that Utah \u201cwelcomes legal immigrants from around the world,\u201d while \u201cWashington sends immigrants a message of exclusion.\u201dRomney, 70, will be the heavy favorite for the Senate seat <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/01/02/republican-sen-orrin-hatch-will-retire-at-the-end-of-his-term/\">being opened by Sen. Orrin Hatch\u2019s retirement</a>. Hatch was among the first Republicans to pitch Romney as his potential successor.Leading up to Romney\u2019s <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2017/11/10/mitt-romney-mulling-2018-senate-run-in-utah/\">widely anticipated announcement</a>, confidantes said he intends to focus his campaign on Utah, where he moved with his wife, Ann, after losing the 2012 presidential election to incumbent Democrat Barack Obama.\u201cUtah has a lot to teach the politicians in Washington,\u201d Romney said in his announcement, noting that \u201con Utah\u2019s Capitol Hill, people treat one another with respect.\u201dStill, Romney, a former Massachusetts governor and wealthy business executive, would come to Capitol Hill with a higher profile than a typical freshman senator. That reality was made clear by immediate reactions to his announcement from across the political spectrum.House Speaker Paul Ryan, whom Romney tapped as his vice presidential running mate in 2012, immediately hailed his old partner\u2019s \u201cunparalleled experience, conservative leadership and lifetime of service.\u201d\u2014 Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MittRomney/status/964489491682504704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 16, 2018</a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>Democrats, despite not yet offering any credible threat to the Republican dominance in Utah, answered with a scathing rebuke, dismissing Romney\u2019s periodic criticisms of Trump. \u201cMitt Romney desperately wants to separate himself from the extremism of the current administration,\u201d said Democratic National Committee spokesman Vedant Patel in a statement, but \u201cthe basis policies of Trump\u2019s GOP \u2026 were his before they were Donald Trump\u2019s.\u201dHours after making his campaign announcement early Friday morning, Romney filed paperwork with Utah\u2019s elections office allowing him to start collecting the signatures of 28,000 registered Republicans to earn a spot on a June primary ballot.He then toured a dairy farm in the northern Utah city of Ogden, driving a tractor and posing for pictures with workers and the farm\u2019s owners. He didn\u2019t take questions from reporters.Friday afternoon, Romney dropped by a campaign volunteer booth set up at Utah Valley University in Orem, where he shook hands and posed for pictures with a mob of excited college students he asked to sign his candidate nominating petition.He is scheduled to give a speech Friday night at a GOP county dinner event in Provo, a city south of Salt Lake City.As he did in two presidential campaigns, Romney\u2019s announcement highlights his stewardship of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. Romney is respected in the state for taking over the troubled games amid planning and financial disarray.Romney supporters describe him as a \u201cfavorite son\u201d of Utah. He\u2019s a Brigham Young University graduate who went on to become the first Mormon presidential nominee of a major political party. About 60 percent of Utah\u2019s residents are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.Some Utah Republicans may still question whether the one-time abortion-rights supporter is too much of an outsider or too moderate for their tastes, but he\u2019s not expected to face any serious primary or general election challenge.Romney attracted headlines in 2016 when he took the extraordinary step of delivering a biting speech denouncing Trump, calling him a \u201cphony\u201d who was unfit for office. Romney muted his criticism for a time when Trump auditioned him as a potential secretary of state.For his part, Trump has said Romney \u201cchoked like a dog\u201d in his failed presidential bids in 2012 and four years earlier, when Romney lost the GOP nomination to Arizona Sen. John McCain.Romney also would be a compelling addition to the ongoing congressional wrangle over health care. As Massachusetts governor, Romney enacted a sweeping health insurance overhaul that became a model for the insurance exchanges in 2010 Affordable Care Act.Amid intense conservative opposition to the national law, however, Romney distanced himself during his 2012 campaign from his Massachusetts accomplishments, arguing that he had pursued a state solution that wasn\u2019t appropriate at the federal level.",
    "2018 - 4632": "MOSCOW \u2014 A Clinton-Obama sex tape using body doubles. A Facebook page promoting Texas independence riddled with grammatical mistakes. Islamic State anthems blasting out during the nightshift.The U.S. indictment <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4380517-Russia-probe-indictments.html\">centered on a Russian troll farm</a> only scratches the surface of the St. Petersburg agency that allegedly produced online content to sway the 2016 presidential election \u2014 and glosses over how unconvincing some of its stunts could be.Many of the more eye-popping accounts of the Internet Research Agency\u2019s activities have come from former staff members. One, Alan Baskaev, told the independent Russian television channel Rain last year that the agency made a video that looked like a U.S. soldier shooting a Quran and had even hired two actors in an abortive bid to fake a sex tape of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.\u201cNo one would buy it, clearly,\u201d Baskaev told the broadcaster, laughing.The Associated Press couldn\u2019t confirm Baskaev\u2019s sex tape story, but a video of a purported U.S. soldier in desert camouflage firing an assault-style weapon at a Quran was posted to an American gun forum in September 2015.The fakery was screamingly obvious: The soldier\u2019s uniform was misshapen and out of date. His helmet resembled the headwear a cyclist might wear and the English he spoke was so heavily accented it was almost indecipherable.The BBC\u2019s Russian service <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/russian/society/2016/03/160315_smj_trolls_make_haram_video\">identified the man in 2016</a> as a bartender in St. Petersburg, a friend of someone who worked at the troll factory.The Quran video and others like it were ignominious flops. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html\">The New York Times Magazine in 2015 identified</a> other fake videos, including footage meant to spark panic about a chemical plant explosion in Louisiana supposedly caused by the Islamic State group. Another showed a phony shooting in Atlanta, Georgia, that carried echoes of Michael Brown\u2019s fatal 2014 encounter with police in Ferguson, Missouri.The indictment that <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/02/16/mueller-indicts-russian-nationals-in-election-meddling/\">charged 13 Russians with meddling</a> in the presidential race makes no mention of them, but the amateurish videos continued through the election. Last year <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/russia-recruited-youtubers-to-bash-racist-btch-hillary-clinton-over-rap-beats\">The Daily Beast said</a> it had identified \u201cWilliams and Kalvin\u201d \u2014 a rap duo purportedly from Atlanta that appeared in YouTube videos \u2014 as operatives of the Russian troll operation. Speaking in a thick Nigerian accent, the man who went by Williams slammed Hillary Clinton as a racist and said, \u201cThis is time for change.\u201d\u201cLet our vote go for Trump, because this man is a businessman, he\u2019s not a politician,\u201d he continued. \u201cAny businessman cannot be a racist.\u201dThe cringe-inducing quality of such videos and other pieces of the trolls\u2019 work is another aspect of the alleged interference left out of the indictment \u2014 and much of the attendant media coverage.The agency did manage to organize rallies in the U.S., but turnout appears to have been microscopic. Even online, the trolls struggled with their command of English. One of the Internet Research Agency\u2019s most popular Facebook pages, the secessionist-minded Heart of Texas, was packed with malapropisms.\u201cHillary Clinton behind bars is a dream of thousands of Americans and may the god this dream come true,\u201d reads one of the Facebook posts that <a href=\"https://extranewsfeed.com/how-russia-created-the-most-popular-texas-secession-page-on-facebook-fd4dfd05ee5c\">journalist Casey Michael eventually collected</a>. \u201cTexas is a heaven of Earth, a land give to us by Lord himself!\u201d reads another.The nonsensical quality of the work would be no surprise to former troll farm employee Baskaev. He described a slap-dash operation whose internet connections frequently failed and whose fake profiles repeatedly got spiked by Facebook administrators.When the managers had gone home, the 20-somethings working the night shift at the troll farm ran amok, he said, playing Islamic State anthems over the sound system and jokingly saluting each other with the Ukrainian nationalist greeting, \u201cGlory to Ukraine!\u201dThe indictment alleges that the troll farm sent operatives to the United States. Baskaev said the same to Rain last year, but added that he doubted any of them accomplished much in the U.S.\u201cThey probably just went out boozing and partying,\u201d he said.",
    "2018 - 4579": "BOISE, Idaho \u2014 A Republican Idaho state senator yelled \u201cabortion is murder\u201d at a group of students who were pushing for birth control legislation at the Statehouse and now faces an ethics complaint after a post from an unverified Twitter account told them to discuss \u201ckilling babies\u201d with a Democratic lawmaker.Sen. Dan Foreman <a href=\"http://newsroom.ap.org/detail/text/US--Lawmaker-PlannedParenthood/2eb3238f825d4bf5ab51b9eef3426694?id=16D0D1F0-7DAC-467E-8561-67B4C70FF227&amp;st=hpsection&amp;mediaType=text&amp;sortBy=arrivaldatetime:desc&amp;dateRange=Anytime&amp;totalCount=3914&amp;currentItemNo=23\">told the Associated Press</a> on Tuesday that he has no plans to apologize and denied any ties to the social media account that purported to belong to him.\u201cI think the response was dead on and people can take exception to that \u2014 they\u2019re welcome to their point of view \u2014 but I take abortion seriously. It\u2019s murder,\u201d Foreman said.Senate President Pro Tem Brent Hill, who led a \u201crespectful workplace training\u201d event for all lawmakers in January, apologized for the way the students were treated and said Foreman\u2019s behavior reflects on the Legislature.\u201cI told him it wasn\u2019t an appropriate response; we need to conduct ourselves with much more dignity, civility and respect,\u201d said Hill, a Republican. \u201cI think he understands that I\u2019m not very happy with how he conducted himself.\u201dAbout a dozen University of Idaho students from Foreman\u2019s district in the city of Moscow had traveled nearly 300 miles for a scheduled meeting with him Monday. They planned to lobby for a Planned Parenthood-backed measure in the conservative state that would allow women to receive up to a 12-month supply of prescribed birth control and would promote better sex education on college campuses.Foreman abruptly canceled the meeting, and the students left a note and condoms in his office before heading to other meetings with lawmakers. He later passed the students in the hallway, and several recorded him shouting, \u201cAbortion is murder.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a Roman Catholic and a conservative Republican. I think what you guys are doing stinks,\u201d Foreman says on the video.The students were not at the Capitol to talk about abortion, said Paul Dillon, public affairs director of Planned Parenthood of Greater Washington and North Idaho.They were encouraging lawmakers to vote in favor of the birth control measure, and other meetings were peaceful, even if the lawmakers disagreed, Dillon said. He described Foreman as \u201ccompletely unhinged.\u201d\u201cEven if you disagree with what we have to say, there\u2019s no excuse for that kind behavior,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cHe was being a bully.\u201dLater Monday, a tweet from the unverified Twitter account said someone in the group had a \u201cwild outburst\u201d at the meeting time and directed the students to \u201cgo talk about killing babies with Maryanne Jordan,\u201d a Democratic senator. That prompted Jordan to file an ethics complaint against Foreman.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to disagree with policy, it\u2019s another thing to position something like that against another lawmaker,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cThis type of behavior is beneath the Idaho Senate.\u201dEthics complaints against lawmakers are typically anonymous, so while Jordan confirmed she filed a complaint, she did not reveal many details. The Senate president said he could not speak about the complaint because of rules that dictate how ethics investigations are handled.After the complaint was filed, the roughly year-old unverified Twitter account was deleted, then briefly reactivated to say it was not affiliated with Foreman and deleted again.Foreman denied any involvement, and a message seeking comment with the account manager was not returned.It\u2019s not the first time Foreman has raised eyebrows for breaking decorum.Earlier this year, Foreman stormed out of a committee meeting when the chairman didn\u2019t allow him to argue a measure that wasn\u2019t on the agenda.Last year, body-camera video from a sheriff\u2019s deputy showed Foreman swearing and shouting insults with an unseen and unidentified male on Sept. 14. The deputy asked Foreman to move along.Foreman, 64, is a retired US Air Force officer and retired Moscow police officer. He was narrowly elected to the Idaho Senate in 2016 in a surprise upset, ousting longtime Democratic Sen. Dan Schmidt.During his first legislative session, Foreman shocked both parties by backing a proposal that would have classified abortion as first-degree murder \u2014 for the woman and the doctor.The measure never got a hearing. This year, Foreman has supported toughening Idaho\u2019s abortion laws through a ballot initiative.",

He apologized and asked for privacy for his family.Their affair became public during Edwards\u2019 own divorce proceedings.Edwards, a native of Cranberry, Pennsylvania, has worked as a forensic psychologist with family and criminal courts.The Post-Gazette described Edwards as a former political independent who is now a registered Republican.",
    "2018 - 2090": "CHICAGO \u2014 More women appear to be traveling to Illinois from out of state to have an abortion, according to Illinois Department of Public Health figures, and activists say it could be because surrounding states have tighter restrictions.A December state report says more than 4,500 women crossed into Illinois to terminate a pregnancy in 2016. That compares with just over 3,200 abortions provided to out-of-state women in the previous year.Overall, the number of abortions performed in Illinois dropped from more than 39,800 in 2015 to fewer than 38,400 in 2016, <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-met-abortion-numbers-illinois-20180222-story.html\">the Chicago Tribune reported</a>.Both anti-abortion and abortion rights activists speculate that tighter regulations in other Midwest states could be sending more women to Illinois.Illinois has been expanding abortion access, but many neighboring states, including Wisconsin, Missouri, Iowa, Indiana and Kentucky, have passed restrictions.\u201cIllinois is surrounded by states with restrictive barriers that make it very difficult for patients to get the care they need,\u201d said Planned Parenthood of Illinois spokeswoman Julie Lynn.More permissive laws are detrimental to women and the unborn, said Emily Troscinski, executive director of Illinois Right to Life.\u201cIllinois has become a dumping ground for other states with our flimsy abortion laws and politicians\u2019 flippant attitude toward providing women with resources on all their options,\u201d she said.Troscinski attributed the overall drop in abortions to more young people identifying as \u201cpro-life,\u201d as well as resources that provide support to women who have unplanned pregnancies and choose to carry to term. She said she fears that the number of abortions in the state will rise after a state law passed last year expanded taxpayer-subsidized abortions to women covered by Medicaid and state employee insurance.\u201cFor or against abortion, purposefully increasing the number of abortions and forcing those who oppose abortion to pay for the increase is appalling,\u201d said Troscinski.",
    "2018 - 3579": "EPA chief Scott Pruitt in 2005 dismissed the theory of evolution, criticized \u201cminority religions\u201d and called for constitutional amendments to ban abortion and prohibit same-sex marriages, according to radio interviews from 2005.\u201cThere aren\u2019t sufficient scientific facts to establish the theory of evolution, and it deals with the origins of man, which is more from a philosophical standpoint than a scientific standpoint,\u201d Pruitt said in an interview on Tulsa\u2019s KFAQ AM, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/02/scott-pruitt-epa-evolution-theory-abortion-gay-marriage-433284\">Politico reported</a>.The then-state senator also described the Second Amendment as divinely granted and slammed federal judges as a \u201cjudicial monarchy\u201d that is \u201cthe most grievous threat that we have today,\u201d according to the newly unearthed interviews.And he did not object when the show\u2019s host described Islam as \u201cnot so much a religion as it is a terrorist organization in many instances,\u201d according to Politico.The six hours of conversations on the station were recently rediscovered by a company researching Pruitt\u2019s past remarks. The firm provided them to Politico on condition of anonymity.While Pruitt\u2019s statements were mostly in line with the views espoused by conservative, devout Christians, they also reflected stances that are odds with the broader American mainstream, and the scientific community.The former Baptist deacon, who was a trustee of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky., acknowledged that the Founding Fathers did not want a church to run the government.And yet, he said society should be centered on some religious ideals or it will descend into \u201cchaos.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re saying to a certain category of religion, \u2018No, you can\u2019t be a part of the public square, because you are the majority religion, historically,\u2019\u201d he said.\u201c\u2019We\u2019re going to make sure that the minority religions are built up and encouraged, but the majority religion is going to be shifted aside.\u2019 Now that violates, again, individual liberty.\u201dPruitt also said states might need to push for amendments to the Constitution that would allow expression of religion in government, declare abortion illegal and prohibit same-sex marriage.But he acknowledged some fears about holding a constitutional convention, which could make widespread changes to the nation\u2019s founding charter.\u201cIt scares me to a large degree to go into something like a constitutional convention, \u2019cause that means that we\u2019re going to have to really be educated, and informed, and debate,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you know what? Maybe it\u2019s time.\u201dIn the recordings, Pruitt also weighed in on a subject that has dominated headlines and sparked a national debate since the Feb. 14 school massacre in Florida.He backed a broad interpretation of the Second Amendment\u2019s right to bear arms, saying it derives from a divine mandate.\u201cIf you can tell me what gun, type of gun, I can possess, then I didn\u2019t really get that right to keep and bear arms from God,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was not bequeathed to me, it was not unalienable, right?\u201dThe Environmental Protection Agency would not say this week whether any of its administrator\u2019s positions have changed since 2005.Asked by Politico whether Pruitt\u2019s skepticism about a major foundation of modern science such as evolution could conflict with the EPA\u2019s mandate to make science-based decisions, spokesman Jahan Wilcox said that \u201cif you\u2019re insinuating that a Christian should not serve in capacity as EPA administrator, that is offensive and a question that does not warrant any further attention.\u201d",
