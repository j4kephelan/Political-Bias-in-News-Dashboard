    "2004 - 1680": " NASHUA, N.H. \u2013 Now the question is whether anyone can stop John Kerry.  If no rival can do it when seven states vote next week, he\u2019s the Democratic nominee.  But Kerry will face a rough week as rivals pull out all the stops to challenge his record now that he\u2019s the certified frontrunner \u2013 scrutiny that he hasn\u2019t yet faced.  Kerry also has to prove that he can win in the South \u2013 and he shot himself in the foot last weekend by dissing a region that\u2019s skeptical of Yankees anyway. Remember how dissing Iowa\u2019s caucuses hurt Howard Dean?  Kerry\u2019s gaffe was to say: \u201cEverybody always makes the mistake of looking South. Al Gore proved he could have been president of the United States without winning one Southern state, including his own.\u201d  Edwards could be Kerry\u2019s biggest obstacle because he has a real chance to win South Carolina, where he tops the polls. But luckily for Kerry, Edwards didn\u2019t get any boost out of New Hampshire.  Dean faces slim pickings for victory but he\u2019s a fighter in a bitter grudge match with Kerry \u2013 and he\u2019ll have plenty of chances to make trouble for Kerry and the cash to do it.  Take South Carolina. If Dean goes after Kerry on hot-button issues like Iraq and abortion, he may yank away liberal voters and boost the chances that Edwards will win.  That\u2019s why a Kerry backer fretted: \u201cThe other guys are establishment Democrats who will fall into line if Kerry looks like the nominee, but the Dean people are loose cannons who have nothing to lose.\u201d  One more key question is how well Kerry wears with voters \u2013 even some Kerry fans thought he looked too preachy and speechy on Sunday\u2019s TV chat shows. Over the long haul, that won\u2019t inspire voters. ",
    "2004 - 3412": "Slip-sliding Democrat Howard Dean last night ditched his campaign manager and reached for help from Al Gore as he sought a way to take on newly crowned front-runner John Kerry.  Dean told reporters that he was enlisting Gore aide Roy Neel as the new campaign CEO and that Gore will campaign for him in South Carolina \u2013 the marquee contest in next week\u2019s seven-state showdown.  Dean announced that Neel would take the new position during a staff meeting, but aides who were present said he did not mention Joe Trippi\u2019s departure.  Trippi then came in and tearfully told his staff that he was leaving.  \u201cHoward Dean is the guy who is going to fight for the country for real change and [I] hope people stick with him,\u201d Trippi said as he left campaign headquarters with his wife, Kathy Lash, who also worked for Dean.  \u201cI\u2019m out of the campaign, but I\u2019m not out of the fight,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to change America.\u201d  Candidates often try staff shakeups when things aren\u2019t going well. Kerry fired his campaign manager last year in the days when Dean seemed all but certain to win, and that turned things around \u2013 but this firing comes in crunch time.  For Dean, the quotable and rumpled Trippi was an Internet genius who many saw as the heart of the Dean operation and the mastermind of its e-funding bonanza.  But disgruntled staffers groused that Trippi got too much attention and signed too many autographs \u2013 a CNN crew taped his every move \u2013 but Dean\u2019s biggest wound was his own \u201cI have a scream\u201d speech after finishing third in Iowa.  Meanwhile, Kerry is now seeking to build a sense of momentum by piling up endorsements \u2013 like Rep. James Clyburn, a pivotal black leader in South Carolina.  As Kerry solidifies his front-runner standing, rivals \u2013 and Republicans \u2013 pored over his record for issues that could hurt him by making him look too liberal, like his opposition to the death penalty and support for partial-birth abortion.  Democratic rivals \u2013 and South Carolina newspapers \u2013 also jabbed Kerry for dissing the South by claiming he doesn\u2019t need to win a single state there to win the White House, an issue likely to come up at tonight\u2019s Greenville debate.  Many Democratic strategists say that someone has to stop Kerry at one of the seven contests next Tuesday or he will be unstoppable \u2013 and the best bet could be the bid by Sen. John Edwards (N.C.) in South Carolina.  Edwards questioned why the Democratic Party would want to try to win the White House without the South \u201cfor the first time in American history,\u201d adding: \u201cIt\u2019s a very risky choice.\u201d  Kerry\u2019s \u2018liberal\u2019 top 10 list   Here are the issues where critics accuse John Kerry of being too \u201cliberal\u201d to win:   1. Against the death penalty in almost all cases.  2. Voted many times against tax cuts.   3. Supported killing a host of military programs like the B-1 and B-2 bomber.  4. Voted against banning \u201cpartial-birth\u201d abortions and against parental notification when minors have abortions.   5. Voted against Defense of Marriage Act, which permits states to refuse to recognize gay marriages in other states.   6. Voted against the 1991 Gulf War.   7. Voted against $87 billion to support U.S. troops and rebuild Iraq.   8. Called for taxing guns and ammunition to pay for anti-crime programs.   9. Pushed to cut CIA funding \u2013 and then complained about inadequate intelligence after 9/11.   10. Supported furloughs for first-degree murderers.",
    "2004 - 828": " A Brooklyn ex-con who allegedly tried to get revenge against his girlfriend by igniting a fire at her apartment building \u2013 killing two incapacitated men \u2013 was arrested yesterday, police sources said.  Jos\u00e9 \u201cCoco\u201d Melendez, 26, of Bushwick, allegedly set the Jan. 9 blaze, which killed a 29-year-old man with Down syndrome and the victim\u2019s 74-year-old father.  Melendez was angry that his gal pal wanted to abort the couple\u2019s child, the sources said.  \u201cThe building\u2019s gonna come down,\u201d Melendez allegedly declared.  His girlfriend was unhurt in the blaze.  But Gilbert Torres and his father, Ruben, were trapped in their apartment and died several days after the fire.  Torres\u2019 mother, Natividad, 69, who suffers from Parkinson\u2019s disease, was seriously injured.  Melendez was charged with murder and arson, police sources said. ",
    "2004 - 4072": "Alex Rodriguez jetted to New York late yesterday and headed straight for old pal and new teammate Derek Jeter\u2019s Big Apple pad just hours after A-Rod officially became a Yankee.   Rodriguez arrived as Bronx Bomber fans rejoiced that their legendary team had nabbed the best player in baseball \u2013 who was unsuccessfully wooed in December by their hated arch rivals, the Boston Red Sox.   The city\u2019s newest sports phenom flew into New York by private jet late yesterday afternoon with his wife, Cynthia, and was immediately driven with Jeter in a black SUV to the Yankee captain\u2019s $13 million apartment in the Trump World Tower near the United Nations.   A-Rod will be formally welcomed by the Yankees today, at a press conference at the House That Ruth Built, where he will don a pinstripe jersey bearing his new lucky number \u2013 13.   \u201cThis is a great day for the New York Yankees and for the City of New York,\u201d crowed team owner George Steinbrenner after baseball Commissioner Bud Selig gave final approval to the blockbuster deal that sent Rodriguez here from the Texas Rangers.   \u201cIn acquiring Alex Rodriguez, we are bringing to New York one of the premier players in the history of the game.\u201d   Rodriguez, 28, made the trade possible by agreeing to move from shortstop, where he won six All-Star team slots and last season\u2019s American League MVP award, to third base, allowing Jeter to stay at his position.   Rodriguez, who was born in New York, will begin spring training in Florida with the team next week.   A-Rod just beamed when a Post photographer caught him outside Jeter\u2019s apartment and asked him how he liked being in the Big Apple.   Yankee GM Brian Cashman was not so reserved.   \u201cI really cannot describe how happy I am to have been able to acquire a player of the caliber of Alex Rodriguez,\u201d he said.   \u201cIt was perhaps a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I am ecstatic that a lot of hard work enabled us to consummate a deal of this magnitude.\u201d   Yankee skipper Joe Torre said, \u201cIt\u2019s tough to come up with words to describe how you feel when a player of Alex\u2019s ability and class is suddenly in your lineup. I know the fans of New York are going to love having him here on an everyday basis. I couldn\u2019t be happier.\u201d   The Yankees will pay Rodriguez $112 million for the remaining seven years of the unprecedented $252 million contract he signed with Texas three seasons ago. The Rangers, in an unusual arrangement, will pay A-Rod the $67 million balance of the contract through 2025.   In exchange for A-Rod, the Rangers are getting star second baseman Alfonso Soriano and a player to be named later from the Yankees.   The deal gives the Yank, who lost last season\u2019s World Series and who have not won it since 2000, a player considered to be a shoo-in for the Hall of Fame.   And it gives A-Rod, whose Rangers have been dreadful despite his presence, the chance to play for a legendary winning team. The Yanks in recent years have either strongly contended for or taken the American League title, and have worn four World Series crowns since 1995.   The trade stunned the baseball world, which had expected A-Rod to stay with the Rangers after a recent aborted attempt to trade him to the Sox.   \u201cI think this is one of the best trades in the history of baseball,\u201d said former Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a rabid Yankee fan. \u201cThis is going to make the season very exciting.\u201d   Manhattan teacher Amy Strassler-Goldstein, who traveled to the Stadium yesterday to buy tickets, said, \u201cIt\u2019s the A-Rod icing on the Yankees cake.\u201d   Anthony Sedia, 38, a construction worker from The Bronx, was there, too.   \u201cThe minute the trade was confirmed, I said, \u2018I\u2019m gonna get season tickets for me and my son,\u2019 \u201d he said.   There also was glee in Rodriguez\u2019s old neighborhood of Washington Heights.   \u201cI think this is a beautiful thing,\u201d said Carlos Rodriguez, 34, a building superintendent in the upper Manhattan community. \u201cIt\u2019ll keep New York in the buzz. I\u2019m so excited for baseball to begin again.\u201d   Additional reporting by Amit Srivastava, Lorena Mongelli and Dan Kadison ",

    "2004 - 1222": " ALBANY \u2013 State Republicans have picked a little-known politician from Orange County to challenge Sen. Charles Schumer, ending a months-long search for a candidate \u2013 whom some quickly labeled a sacrificial lamb.  But Assemblyman Howard Mills, 39, insisted that he at least had a fighting chance to defeat the popular, hard-driving and well-financed Schumer, saying, \u201cI know about his bank account, but I also know about his record: He doesn\u2019t have one.\u201d  Mills, a pro-death penalty, pro-abortion rights moderate from the town of Hamptonburgh, whose campaign committee has a mere $105,000 to a massive $20 million for Schumer, said: \u201cSince Sen. Schumer went to Washington, he has not been able to deliver what New York needs.  \u201cHe\u2019s very interested in trying to generate press on Sunday but we haven\u2019t seen him deliver on Monday,\u201d Mills said.  Schumer, who recent public opinion polls has shown enjoying a near 60 percent approval rate, refused to comment directly on Mills\u2019 selection.  Wealthy Manhattan socialite Gail Hilson, a liberal Republican who in recent weeks was the odds-on favorite to be selected as the candidate, was said by one GOP insider to have been rejected because \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t sell in upstate areas.\u201d ",
    "2004 - 1464": "Three masked teenagers who allegedly lured a food deliveryman to a Bronx building to rob him were bagged yesterday by plainclothes cops, after a suspicious restaurant worker blew the whistle on them.  The cops nabbed a 14-year-old girl, believed to be the lookout, shortly after she pulled a scarf across her face and a hood over her head \u2013 a signal to two 15-year-old boys that the deliveryman was approaching the Fox Street apartment building in Longwood, police sources said.  The boys also covered their faces.  Cops swooped down on the trio before they could rob the deliveryman, who had bicycled from the King Buffet Chinese Takeout on Southern Boulevard.  The deliveryman, who was carrying $25 worth of chicken wings, pork fried rice, fried dumplings and sesame chicken, had volunteered to participate in the sting.  Cops said one of the boys arrested in the 2 p.m. aborted robbery had a boxcutter.  All three were charged with attempted robbery. Their names were withheld because they are juveniles.  Last Friday in Queens, an 18-year-old Chinese-food deliveryman was robbed, beaten and stabbed to death by three other thugs.  In yesterday\u2019s incident, the 23-year-old female worker alerted cops after she recognized the caller\u2019s voice as that of the man who ordered takeout on three other occasions where workers had their deliveries stolen. Each time, the caller would give a different address on Fox Street.<em>Additional reporting by Erika Martinez</em>",
    "2004 - 2581": "GOV. PATAKI\u2019S long-shot candidate to challenge Sen. Charles Schumer is already in trouble with the state\u2019s small but influential Conservative Party.  \u201cI\u2019m not convinced Howard Mills is the best decision for us,\u201d Conservative Party Chairman Michael Long, normally a key Pataki ally, told The Post.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of issues to talk to him about,\u201d said Long of the 39-year-old Orange County Republican who was plucked from obscurity last week by Pataki\u2019s political operatives.  \u201cWe want a candidate in a tough year like this that\u2019s going to be, quite frankly, talking about a conservative agenda,\u201d Long added.  The Conservative Party chairman will sit down with Mills \u2013 a pro-choice moderate assemblyman \u2013 later this week to discuss issues. The party\u2019s support of Mills is considered crucial for any hope of victory.  \u201cI\u2019m not discounting the possibility that we\u2019ll have our own candidate, and there is someone who spoke to me recently who, I think, would make a very good Conservative candidate,\u201d Long said.  Long also took a direct swipe at Mills \u2013 mocking his initial attack on Schumer as a master of the unproductive Sunday press conference.  \u201cThis isn\u2019t about Sunday press conferences, it\u2019s about some meaty stuff here involving the blocking of President Bush\u2019s judicial nominees because they happen to be pro-life and Catholic. It\u2019s about tax cuts and Schumer\u2019s votes in the Senate,\u201d said Long.  His reservations about Mills are believed to be connected, in part, to growing indications that conservative voters are increasingly restless with the liberal spending and social policies of the Pataki administration.  \u201cI think members of our party and, more importantly, conservative Republicans would like to see someone take on Schumer on real serious and thoughtful conservative issues, a real conservative agenda,\u201d Long said.  Meanwhile, Long\u2019s political clout was illustrated in the GOP\u2019s last-minute rejection of millionaire Manhattan socialite Gail Hilson, who wanted to challenge Schumer.  Long, Republican sources said, made it clear to state GOP Chairman Alexander \u201cSandy\u201d Treadwell that the Conservative Party would not back Hilson because of her widely known liberal stands on such issues as abortion, gay rights and rent control.  *  While GOP leaders were biting their tongues and publicly claiming that Mills would be a strong challenger to Schumer, a prominent Republican operative was calling journalists with this observation:  \u201cWhen Mills gets up to give his acceptance speech, he should say, \u2018Baaa, baaa,\u2019 because he\u2019s nothing more than a sacrificial lamb.\u201d "
