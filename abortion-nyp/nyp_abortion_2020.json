Passengers were moved to another plane.Alani told federal investigators he disabled the system that morning because he was upset about how union contract negotiations with the airline had stalled. He said he wanted to make additional overtime for maintenance on the plane, the Herald reported.During a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/american-airlines-mechanic-sabotage-plane-isis\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">detention hearing</a>\u00a0in September, federal prosecutors said\u00a0Alani displayed support for ISIS by making statements about wishing Allah would use \u201cdivine powers\u201d to harm non-Muslims while sharing\u00a0ISIS videos on his cellphone.Alani also reportedly told arresting agents he had an \u201cevil side.\u201d He was not charged with any terrorism-related offense, according to the outlet.\u201cHe made a terrible mistake,\u201d his attorney, Jonathan S. Meltz, said Wednesday, according to the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/american-airlines-mechanic-pleads-guilty-to-tampering-with-plane-11576713655\">Wall Street Journal</a>. \u201cTerrible, terrible lapse in judgment, but it does not make him a terrible man.\u201dAmerican Airlines also issued a statement following Alani\u2019s plea deal.<a href=\"https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a>\u201cWe are grateful for the work of the FBI, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and other officials in resolving this matter,\u201d the statement read. \u201cAmerican Airlines has fully cooperated throughout the investigation. After we learned about the allegations, we inspected aircraft that Mr. Alani had worked on to ensure that they were safe.\u201dAlani faces up to three years in prison. His sentencing is set for March 4.",
    "2020 - 5837": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. \u2014 Boeing safely landed its crew capsule in the New Mexico desert Sunday after an aborted flight to the International Space Station that could hold up the company\u2019s effort to launch astronauts for NASA next year.The Starliner descended into the Army\u2019s White Sands Missile Range in the frigid predawn darkness, ending a two-day demo that should have lasted more than a week. A trio of red, white and blue parachutes popped open and airbags also inflated around the spacecraft to ease the impact.\u201cWe pinpoint landed it,\u201d NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said at a post-landing briefing.The successful return capped a rocky start to a mission that was supposed to include a docking with the space station. Managers will review all the data before deciding whether to do another test flight or go straight to flying astronauts, said NASA\u2019s Steve Stich.After seeing this first test flight cut short and the space station docking canceled because of an improperly set clock on the capsule, Boeing employees were relieved to get the Starliner back.Recovery teams cheered as they watched the capsule drift down through the air and make a bull\u2019s-eye landing. The touchdown was broadcast live on NASA TV; infrared cameras painted the descending capsule in a ghostly white.As the sun rose, close-up views showed the large white and black capsule upright \u2014 with hardly any scorch marks from re-entry \u2014 next to a U.S. flag waving from a recovery vehicle. The astronauts assigned to the first Starliner crew \u2014 two from NASA and one from Boeing \u2014 were part of the welcoming committee.\u201cA beautiful soft landing,\u201d said NASA astronaut Mike Fincke. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to try it out.\u201dIt was the first American-made capsule designed for astronauts to make a ground landing after returning from orbit. NASA\u2019s early crew capsules \u2014 Mercury, Gemini and Apollo \u2014 all had splashdowns. SpaceX\u2019s Dragon capsule, which made its orbital debut last winter with a test dummy, also aims for the ocean at mission\u2019s end.Minutes after touchdown, top NASA and Boeing officials poured into Mission Control in Houston to congratulate the team. The newly returned Starliner also got a personalized name: Calypso, after Jacques Cousteau\u2019s boat.The capsule\u2019s first trip to space began with a smooth rocket ride from Cape Canaveral on Friday. But barely a half hour into the flight, it failed to fire its thrusters to give chase to the space station and ended up in the wrong orbit.The problem was with the Starliner\u2019s internal clock: It did not sync up with the Atlas V rocket and was off by 11 hours, according to Boeing\u2019s Jim Chilton.The capsule burned so much fuel trying to orient itself in orbit that there wasn\u2019t enough left for a space station rendezvous. Flight controllers tried to correct the problem, but between the spacecraft\u2019s position and a gap in communications, their signals did not get through. They later managed to reset the clock.Boeing is still trying to figure out how the timing error occurred. The mission lasted nearly 50 hours and included 33 orbits around the Earth, about 100 orbits fewer than planned.A test dummy named Rosie the Rocketeer \u2014 after Rosie the Riveter from World War II \u2014 rode in the commander\u2019s seat. Also returning were holiday presents, clothes and food that should have been delivered to the space station crew.Even though not all goals were met including a station docking, \u201cin my eyes, it was a huge success,\u201d said Boeing flight director Richard Jones.There were no parachute problems this time. Last month, only two parachutes deployed during an atmospheric test because workers failed to connect a pin in the rigging.\u201cWe didn\u2019t do everything we wanted to do, but we don\u2019t see anything wrong with this spaceship right now,\u201d despite the timing error, Chilton said. He apologized to the six space station residents for not delivering their Christmas presents.Boeing had been shooting for its first astronaut launch in the first half of 2020. This capsule is supposed to be recycled for the second flight with crew; each Starliner is built to fly in space 10 times.The capsule will return to Florida\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in two weeks for inspections and refurbishments.\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of learning in front of us,\u201d Bridenstine said. \u201cBut we have enough information and data to where we can keep moving forward in a very positive way.Despite its own setbacks, SpaceX remains in the lead in NASA\u2019s commercial crew program.SpaceX\u2019s Dragon crew capsule successfully completed its first orbital demo last March. While the flight to the space station went well, the capsule exploded a month later on a test stand at Cape Canaveral.If a launch abort test goes well next month, SpaceX could start launching NASA astronauts by spring and end a nearly nine-year gap in flying people from Cape Canaveral.As its space shuttle program was winding down, NASA looked to private industry to take over cargo and crew deliveries to the space station. SpaceX kicked off supply runs in 2012. Two years later, NASA hired SpaceX and Boeing to ferry astronauts to the orbiting lab.SpaceX got $2.6 billion under NASA\u2019s commercial crew program, while Boeing received more than $4 billion.The goal was to launch NASA astronauts by 2017.Because of delays, NASA is looking to buy another two seats on Russian rockets in 2020 and 2021 to guarantee a continuing U.S. presence on the space station. Even when private companies are regularly carrying up astronauts for NASA, the space agency always will reserve a seat for a Russian in exchange for a free U.S. seat on a Soyuz.Over the years, these Soyuz rides have cost NASA up to $86 million apiece, with the tab totaling in the billions.A recent audit by NASA\u2019s inspector general found a Starliner seat will cost slightly more than that, with a Dragon seat going for just over half the price.",
