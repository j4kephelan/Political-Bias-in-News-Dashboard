    "2008 - 1447": "Mike Huckabee\u2019s surge among Republican voters has turned him into <a class=\"legacy-link\">Rudy Giuliani</a>\u2018s chief rival for the presidential nomination, according to two national polls released yesterday.   A new AP/Ipsos survey showed Huckabee grabbing second place behind Giuliani as his support shot to 18 percent \u2013 nearly doubling his 10 percent backing of a month ago. During the summer, only 3 percent of GOP voters backed Huckabee.   Giuliani remains the front-runner with 26 percent in the poll. <a class=\"legacy-link\">John McCain</a> has 13 percent, Mitt Romney 12 percent and Fred Thompson 11 percent.   Huckabee has vaulted ahead of Giuliani in a separate Rasmussen daily tracking poll. The folksy Baptist minister and ex-Arkansas governor garners 22 percent, followed by Giuliani with 18 percent.   In that survey, Romney gets 13 percent, McCain 12 percent and Thompson 9 percent.   Huckabee\u2019s growing support has come largely from Christian evangelical voters and social conservatives drawn to his faith and long record of opposing abortion and gay marriage, hot-button issues in a GOP primary.   Huckabee has shot to the front of the pack to challenge Romney in Iowa, which is holding its caucus on Jan. 3. While still ahead in most national polls, Giuliani has seen his support drop in some national surveys. And he\u2019s running third in Iowa and behind Romney in New Hampshire, which holds the first-in-the-nation primary on Jan. 8. ",
    "2008 - 1575": " FRED THOMPSON\u2019S disappointed fans have something to cheer about at last.   After sinking to single digits in the polls, the former \u201cLaw &amp; Order\u201d actor is making a comeback.   Over the past month, Thompson has walked away from several very strong performances in GOP debates. In the latest one, he held command over the entire field and won the day by refusing to play \u201chand shows\u201d on stage at the direction of the moderator.   \u201cI said, \u2018Nope,\u2019 and everybody pulled their hand down and looked around,\u201d Thompson later recalled.   \u201cI just said to my buddies up there, \u2018How are you going to stand up to the leaders of Iran and North Korea if you can\u2019t stand up to an overbearing moderator?\u2019 \u201d   Thompson also has quietly racked up scores of endorsements from anti-abortion chapters around the country. Those groups are some of the most effective vote herders the GOP has.   And earlier this week, he netted a surprise endorsement from Iowa Rep. Steve King, known in some GOP circles as \u201cthe Kingmaker.\u201d   After enduring months of criticism for sporadic and lackluster campaigning, Thompson is now going full-bore on a bus tour of 50 cities and towns around Iowa that his campaign says will reach some 75 percent of projected Republican caucus-goers before Jan. 3.   More than anything else, long-suffering supporters say their spirits have finally been lifted by Thompson\u2019s swagger and enthusiastic demeanor on the trail.   After someone suggested he might still be the conservative dark horse to ride to the White House, he quipped, \u201cSaddle me up!\u201d<em>churt@nypost.com</em>",
    "2008 - 5099": "He\u2019s a beefy, blue-collar pipe-layer who played high school football and dropped out of college because it \u201cwasn\u2019t for him.\u201d   She\u2019s a perky, home-schooled former cheerleader from a dysfunctional family.   They both go to church and grew up about an hour apart.   They should be the perfect couple \u2013 except she\u2019s one of the most popular tween stars in the nation, and now she\u2019s knocked up at 16.   Teen queen Jamie Lynn Spears, pop tart Britney\u2019s 16-year-old younger sister who shocked the world last week with news that she\u2019s pregnant, met the more private Casey Aldridge when she was just 13.   She was already a star on Nickelodeon sketch comedy show \u201cAll That\u201d and made Disney\u2019s top 40 countdown with a remake of \u201cGirls Just Wanna Have Fun.\u201d Aldridge was just 15, a star high school athlete playing center field and running back at Amite School Center, \u201chome of the rebels.\u201d   They met at church, according to Aldridge\u2019s great-uncle Rev. Odus Jackson, through mutual friends. Their two towns are about an hour apart, so they probably didn\u2019t meet by chance, he said.   Friends said they had a \u201cnormal\u201d relationship. Jamie Lynn cheered on her strapping boy at several of his baseball games, according to former teammate Seth Monaghan.   She also attended several family functions at the Aldridge family\u2019s 500-acre dirt-road compound in Gloster, Miss. Several family members live on the property in houses ranging from rundown to well kept.   Jamie Lynn has rung in the new year with the clan for the past two years, sitting around the bonfire and enjoying the midnight fireworks, family members said. She also had Thanksgiving dinner with the family last month.   Both families seem to support the relationship.   Aldridge\u2019s blue-collar dad, Mark \u2013 who moved to Cleveland, Tenn., with his wife six months ago to take a job as a maintenance tech, repairing machines at the BoWater paper mill \u2013 bragged to colleagues that his son was dating <a class=\"legacy-link\">Britney Spears</a>\u2018 sister, sources at the plant said.   Meanwhile, Jamie Lynn\u2019s mom, Lynne, welcomed Aldridge into the southern California condo she shares with Jamie Lynn while she\u2019s filmng \u201cZoe 101,\u201d a hit show on Nickelodeon that premiered in 2005.   The rugged, 6-foot-2 Aldridge, who graduated from high school in June, spent most of the summer and parts of his senior year at the pad in Valencia, Calif.   The two were snapped walking around in July, reportedly house-hunting for their own love nest, and the National Enquirer that same month claimed the duo had a pregnancy scare \u2013 something Spears\u2019 spokesperson denied, saying Jamie Lynn was a \u201cmorally upright\u201d 16-year-old.   When Aldridge headed to Louisiana in the fall to attend junior college, Spears cast doubt on their future, telling papers she wasn\u2019t dating anyone special.   Less than a month later, Aldridge had dropped out and found a job as a pipe layer for a Baton Rouge oil company. Spears was soon back at his side, attending local haunts and parties with him while living at home in Kentwood and going to school at the elite Christian school, Parklane Academy, where big sister Brit also attended.   Jacqueline Robertson, who lives in Liberty, Miss., not far from Gloster, said she attended the birthday party of a family friend two months ago, where she met the younger Spears and Aldridge.   \u201cCasey and Jamie Lynn were in the living room,\u201d she said. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t drinking, she wasn\u2019t smoking, she was very nice. She took pictures with all the kids there. She\u2019s really good with kids.\u201d   Robertson said the bubbly Jamie Lynn acted like any other teenager.   \u201cShe was very casual. She wore blue jeans and a long-sleeve T-shirt, no makeup, ponytail, very friendly. She was laughing and she seemed so sweet.\u201d   For many people \u2013 family friends as well as loyal fans \u2013 sweetness is Jamie Lynn\u2019s defining characteristic, expressed through her warm brown eyes and a wide, beaming smile.   Ten years younger than her pop-star sister, she grew up in Britney\u2019s shadow, but had managed in recent years to carve out a niche of her own at Nickelodeon by trading on her wholesome good looks.   She navigated her burgeoning stardom with grace and good sense, family members said, making sure her cadre of close girlfriends were included in her success by offering them supporting roles in movies and commercials, and sometimes bringing them on her Hollywood trips.   Last year she made the cheerleading squad at Parklane, but left the school to do online correspondence classes this year, said Parklane headmaster Billy Swindle.   Good thing, too, because the institution has a policy against allowing pregnant students to attend classes.   \u201cYou cannot be pregnant and attend Parklane Academy,\u201d Swindle said.   Both Aldridge and Jamie Lynn remained mum yesterday.   But GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee has spoken up, praising Jamie Lynn in an interview with CBS News for making the \u201cright decision\u201d by not aborting her child. <em>Additional reporting by Jill Culora in DC, Melissa Jane Kronfeld in NY and Benjamin Johnson in Tennessee</em><em>gotis@nypost.com</em>",
    "2008 - 3282": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Republican White House candidate Mike Huckabee yesterday went hunting in Iowa and bagged a pheasant \u2013 but it was rival Mitt Romney who was really in his sights.   Hunting \u201cis not something we had to go out and get a primer in,\u201d the lifelong outdoorsman Huckabee told reporters in a jab at Romney, who has never been licensed to hunt or owned a gun.   \u201cIt\u2019s very much ordinary to me . . . I certainly understand the culture of being outdoors.\u201d   Gun owners are a key Republican voting group in Iowa, which holds its first-in-the-nation caucuses next Thursday.   Huckabee, who started hunting at 11, has made stunning gains on Romney in recent polls and is now running slightly ahead of the former Massachusetts governor in Iowa.   Huckabee\u2019s spirits were high yesterday morning as he pondered naming his hunting party\u2019s kills after his opponents and made joking references to the time that Vice President Dick Cheney accidentally shot a friend in the face.   \u201cHopefully, we\u2019ll just shoot pheasants and not each other,\u201d Huckabee quipped, noting that he hadn\u2019t invited Cheney \u201cbecause I want to survive all the way through this.\u201d   Huckabee led a motorcade of photographers along gravel roads in the hills outside Osceola, Iowa, hopping out of a pickup truck to take to a snow-covered field wearing his bright orange vest along with Dude, an energetic hunting dog.   Huckabee and three hunting companions tramped slowly across the field and their shotguns were blasting within minutes.   Of four birds flushed by the party, three were felled. Huckabee claimed the third \u2013 a brightly colored ring-necked pheasant \u2013 with his 12-gauge shotgun.   Huckabee proudly displayed the birds and said jokingly, \u201cSee that\u2019s what happens if you get in my way.\u201d   He added, \u201cEach of these birds gave their lives for the campaign.\u201d   Outdoor Life, a magazine which claims a readership of over 5.5 million, last month named Huckabee \u201cone of the 25 most influential people in hunting and fishing\u201d \u2013 the only presidential candidate to win that placing.   On a farm about 30 miles south of the Iowa capital Des Moines, Huckabee extolled the hunter\u2019s love for the environment, and role in preserving it for future generations.   \u201cIn many cases extinction comes from not having some level of hunting. It\u2019s the hunters who actually keep the wildlife alive. A lot of people think that when you hunt, you\u2019re destroying the wildlife.\u201d   Romney tried to get a piece of the gun owners\u2019 votes early this year when he claimed to have received a National Rifle Association endorsement as a candidate for governor and called himself a hunter.   He later was forced to admit that his hunting activities were confined mostly to \u201csmall varmints\u201d and that he had not received that valuable endorsement after all.   Huckabee\u2019s surge in support is thought to be coming from the very group that has suspicions about Romney \u2013 the evangelical Christians.   Romney has fought from the beginning of his campaign to convince them that he shares their socially conservative views, but his record as a governor allowed opponents to brand him a \u201cflip-flopper\u201d on abortion laws and gay rights. <em>With Post Wire Services</em><em><a class=\"a10blb\" href=\"mailto:daphne.retter@nypost.com\">daphne.retter@nypost.com</a></em>",
    "2008 - 4080": "<a class=\"legacy-link\">Barack Obama</a> took a commanding lead over <a class=\"legacy-link\">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a> in the final major Iowa poll released last night \u2013 just three days before Iowans cast the nation\u2019s first ballots in the 2008 race for the White House.   Obama led with 32 percent, according to the benchmark survey conducted by the Des Moines Register.   Clinton trailed beyond the margin of error with 25 percent, essentially tied with John Edwards, at 24.   Among Republicans, Mike Huckabee holds a comfortable lead, with 32 percent, followed by Mitt Romney, at 26.   Rudy Giuliani barely registered in last place, with a paltry 5 percent support in a state he abandoned.   The Iowa contest for Democrats remains competitive, according to the Register\u2019s analysis, because roughly one-third of likely caucus-goers say they could be persuaded to switch their support.   But Obama\u2019s lead in last night\u2019s poll is the largest recorded all year by the Register, which is widely credited with performing the most accurate and comprehensive polling for the tricky-to-gauge Iowa caucuses.   The telephone survey of 800 likely Democratic caucus participants was conducted Dec. 27-30 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.   Last night\u2019s release of the poll followed a bizarre campaign event by the GOP front-runner .   Huckabee held a press conference at which he announced he was abruptly yanking a TV attack ad against Romney \u2013 but then proceeded to show it to the media.   \u201cOnce you see it, you\u2019ll realize this is why we\u2019re not going to run it,\u201d Huckabee told stunned journalists, some of whom nervously chuckled and gasped at the unusual spectacle.   Huckabee insisted he wanted to finish the Iowa battle on a positive note.   \u201cWe will run only ads that talk about why I should be president, and not why Mitt Romney shouldn\u2019t,\u201d he said.   But the room at the Marriott Hotel in Des Moines was filled with placards that said \u201cEnough is Enough.\u201d   That has been Huckabee\u2019s response to Romney\u2019s hard-hitting ads attacking his record, particularly pardoning convicted murderers as Arkansas governor.   There were easels filled with opposition research that slammed Romney\u2019s shifting positions or statements on immigration, guns, taxes and abortion.   Then Huckabee and his staff cued up the ad on a TV monitor.   The narrator says, \u201cRomney\u2019s record \u2013 over $700 million in new taxes . . . Left office with a deficit . . . No executions . . . Supported gun control . . . And Romney\u2019s government-mandated health plan provided a $50 co-pay for an abortion.\u201d   \u201cIf a man is dishonest to obtain a job,\u201d Huckabee says on screen, \u201che\u2019ll be dishonest on the job. Iowans deserve better.\u201d   The ad had been sent to TV stations, but Huckabee\u2019s campaign pulled it before it aired.   Romney\u2019s campaign was quick to respond.   \u201cTo say one thing one minute and then turn around and show an attack ad to reporters the next will obviously leave folks with a very cynical view of Mike Huckabee and his message,\u201d said Romney spokesman Kevin Madden.   Before the latest poll was released, Clinton mocked the raging populist style of Edwards.   \u201cIt\u2019s easy to talk about taking on the special interests,\u201d she told a crowd of a few hundred in southeast Iowa.   \u201cIt\u2019s something you don\u2019t have to do by yelling and screaming . . . Save your energy. Get the job done. Figure out how you\u2019re going to make it happen.\u201d   Clinton ridiculed Edwards \u2013 without saying his name \u2013 for having a temper tantrum over the nation\u2019s problem, even as she laced remarks with prairie populist broadsides against \u201cspecial interests\u201d and \u201cthe rich.\u201d   And there were last-minute dirty tricks. Iowa voters reported receiving phone calls slamming the top three Democratic candidates.   Some of the calls say Obama\u2019s health plan leaves millions uninsured, that Edwards\u2019 plan to withdraw troops from Iraq is dangerous and that Clinton can\u2019t defeat Republicans in the fall if she\u2019s the Democratic nominee.<em><a class=\"a10blb\" href=\"mailto:charles.hurt@nypost.com\">charles.hurt@nypost.com</a></em>",
    "2008 - 3884": "DES MOINES, Iowa \u2013 Former Baptist minister Mike Huckabee won a \u201cmiracle\u201d victory over top rival Mitt Romney in last night\u2019s Iowa caucuses   Huckabee had 34 percent of the vote to Romney\u2019s 25 percent, with 86 percent of precincts reporting. The Associated Press called the race for Huckabee an hour after the caucuses had started.   Actor-politician Fred Thompson and resurgent Sen. <a class=\"legacy-link\">John McCain</a> were tied for third place, at 13 percent apiece. <a class=\"legacy-link\">Rudy Giuliani</a> finished last, with 3 percent, behind gadfly candidate Ron Paul.   Huckabee fittingly compared his win to a biblical David vs. Goliath story, in which he was outspent by the self-financed Romney by 20 to 1.   \u201cPeople really are more important than the purse,\u201d he told cheering supporters at his victory party.   \u201cTonight, we proved that American politics is still in the hands of ordinary folks like you . . . It starts here but it doesn\u2019t end here. It goes all the way through the other states and ends at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\u201d   The Arkansas ex-governor\u2019s first-place showing was a major blow to Romney, who had spent millions of dollars and made hundreds of trips to the Hawkeye State over the past two years.   The \u201cHuckaboom\u201d gives McCain a better chance to beat Romney in the New Hampshire primary next Tuesday. Romney was the governor of neighboring Massachusetts.   The Iowa results also bolster Giuliani\u2019s longer-term strategy of emerging from a muddled early field to win the big, delegate-rich states that vote later, such as Florida, on Jan. 29, and New York, New Jersey and California on Feb. 5.   While Giuliani had hoped to avoid finishing last, he did not compete fiercely in Iowa and a poor showing was expected. He did not put up TV ads and his visits were sporadic.   Romney conceded last night, saying, \u201cSee you in New Hampshire\u201d and vowing to \u201cgrow\u201d support across the country.   Romney sought to put a positive spin on his defeat, saying he had trailed Huckabee by more than 20 points a few weeks ago.   \u201cI\u2019ve been pleased that I\u2019ve been able to make up ground and I intend to keep making up ground,\u201d he said.   Romney had led in Iowa polls for much of the year. He organized early and visited often and dominated the airwaves.   But Huckabee caught fire over the final six weeks as Christian fundamentalists flocked to his cause. He first gained notice after finishing second to Romney in the Iowa Straw Poll last August.   A gifted speaker with a folksy sense of humor who plays bass guitar at events, Huckabee also did well in many of the debates.   He drew huge crowds at campaign events, including more than 2,000 at a New Year\u2019s bash with Hollywood supporter Chuck Norris.   Romney may have been hurt by conservative Christians\u2019 skepticism about his Mormon faith.   Some Huckabee backers called Mormonism a cult on their candidate\u2019s Web site.   Huckabee was forced to apologize after he was quoted suggesting that Mormons believe the devil is the son of Jesus.   Huckabee also chafed at an avalanche of Romney TV ads that attacked his record on pardoning convicted murderers as Arkansas governor and backing tuition aid for illegal aliens.   And an anti-tax group \u2013 the Club for Growth \u2013 also ran ads slamming Huckabee for raising taxes as governor.   In turn, Huckabee \u2013 a lifelong opponent of abortion \u2013 slammed Romney as a flip-flopper for changing his position from pro-choice to pro-life shortly before running for president.   Some of Huckabee\u2019s missteps \u2013 such as not knowing about the National Intelligence Estimate report on Iran \u2013 didn\u2019t damage him, at least in Iowa.   Romney had a well-oiled campaign machine in Iowa. But Huckabee had the faithful \u2013 members of churches and parents who home-school their children \u2013 turn out for him.<em><a class=\"a10blb\" href=\"mailto:carl.campanile@nypost.com\">carl.campanile@nypost.com</a></em>",
    "2008 - 3316": "MANCHESTER, NH \u2013 <a class=\"legacy-link\">Barack Obama</a> had a bull\u2019s-eye on his back in last night\u2019s Republican debate \u2013 with both <a class=\"legacy-link\">Rudy Giuliani</a> and <a class=\"legacy-link\">John McCain</a> calling the freshman senator unqualified to lead.   \u201cSenator Obama does not have the national-security experience and background to lead this nation,\u201d said Sen. McCain (R-Ariz.), a former Vietnam War POW.   Giuliani added that the new Democratic front-runner \u201creally doesn\u2019t have the experience, either from a national-security point of view or an executive point of view.\u201d   Meanwhile, Mike Huckabee and Mitt Romney exchanged fire over national security in a debate crucial to all would-be successors to President Bush.   The forum, held at Saint Anselm College, took place three days before Tuesday\u2019s New Hampshire primary.   Romney got things started by blasting Huckabee for criticizing Bush\u2019s aggressive foreign policy.   \u201cI disagree with the governor\u2019s writing in Foreign Affairs magazine that the president was arrogant and had a bunker mentality,\u201d Romney said during the nationally televised, prime-time debate, sponsored by ABC News and Facebook.   \u201cWe\u2019re not \u2018a bunker mentality,\u2019 \u201d the former governor of Massachusetts said as he fixed his eyes on the former governor of Arkansas. \u201cThe president is not \u2018arrogant.\u2019 We owe the president a debt of gratitude for keeping this country safe.\u201d   To which Huckabee responded: \u201cI supported the president before you did. I supported the [troop] surge [in Iraq] before you did.\u201d   Then, when Huckabee charged that Romney backed a time withdrawal of troops from Iraq, it was Romney\u2019s turn to strike back.   \u201cGovernor,\u201d he said, \u201cdon\u2019t characterize my position.\u201d   But Huckabee, the Republican winner in last Thursday\u2019s Iowa caucuses, didn\u2019t miss a beat.   \u201cWhich one?\u201d he quipped, snidely referring to Romney\u2019s well-documented shifts on abortion and other hot-button issues.   The candidates also sparred over illegal immigration and national security.   \u201cGovernor, I agree with you \u2013 you <em>are</em> the candidate of change,\u201d said McCain, charging Romney with having flip-flopped on immigration in hope of winning votes.   Romney replied that \u201cthe continued personal remarks are interesting but are unnecessary\u201d \u2013 then accused McCain of pushing a bill that would have required amnesty for immigrants who were in this country illegally.   McCain would have none of it.   \u201cI never supported amnesty,\u201d he shot back. \u201cYou can spend a fortune on these attack ads, but that does not make it true.\u201d   All but antiwar candidate Rep. Ron Paul backed Bush\u2019s policy of preemption, including invading Iraq. And they all praised Bush for preventing other terrorist attacks.   This was the first debate since Huckabee won Iowa on the wings of Christian fundamentalists who flocked to his cause. Romney came in second.   \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest in this debate,\u201d said Fergus Cullen, chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party. \u201cIt will have great ratings.\u201d   Tuesday\u2019s primary is considered a must win for Romney, well known in New England, and for McCain, who won the GOP primary here in 2000 and has practically camped out in the Granite State the last month.<em><a class=\"a10blb\" href=\"mailto:carl.campanile@nypost.com\">carl.campanile@nypost.com</a></em>",
    "2008 - 3358": "NASHUA, NH \u2013 <a class=\"legacy-link\">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a>, trailing by as much as 13 points in New Hampshire polls, went on a rampage yesterday against <a class=\"legacy-link\">Barack Obama</a> \u2013 ripping him as all talk and no action and blasting his votes on everything from Iraq to ethics in a slash-and-burn effort to deny him a victory here.   With her game face on just two days before New Hampshire\u2019s primary, Clinton hit the warpath by saying the country needs a \u201cdoer, not a talker\u201d \u2013 then eviscerated Obama on lobbyists, Iraq, and ethics.   \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be railing about lobbyists, and then you have the chair of your campaign who is a major lobbyist in this state, that\u2019s a very important piece of information for voters,\u201d she said, referring to Obama\u2019s New Hampshire chair, Jim Demers, who lobbies for drug companies.   Clinton \u2013 whose inner circle is girding for a possible defeat in New Hampshire\u2019s primary tomorrow \u2013 ran through issues where she said Obama\u2019s words didn\u2019t match his deeds, repeating each time, \u201cThat\u2019s not change.\u201d   \u201cIf you gave a speech and a very good speech against the war in Iraq in 2002, and then in 2004 you\u2019re saying you\u2019re not sure how you would have voted, and by 2007 you voted for $300 billion for the war you said you were against, that\u2019s not change,\u201d she said.   Clinton voted for the Iraq war resolution in 2002, plus several measures to pay for it, although she now wants to bring the troops home.   Moments after her Iraq broadside, Clinton said of the war, \u201cAfter 9/11, I would never have taken us to war in Iraq.\u201d   She added, \u201cIf you say that you are going to prevent members of Congress from having lunch with lobbyists sitting down \u2013 but they can still have lunch standing up, that\u2019s not change.\u201d   The line was a reference to a loophole that allows lobbyists to throw fund-raisers with finger food. Clinton voted for the ethics bill, which Obama co-sponsored.   Obama, who was endorsed by former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley yesterday, said, : \u201cFor many months I\u2019ve been teased, almost derided for talking about hope.   \u201cYou saw it in the debates last night. One of my opponents said we can\u2019t just, you know, offer the American people false hopes about what we can get done.\u201d   Last night, Team Clinton lobbed another grenade, saying that Obama\u2019s camp \u201cmay be violating the law\u201d by sending out automated \u201crobo-calls\u201d to New Hampshire voters on a do-not-call list.   Those calls challenge Clin ton\u2019s charges that Obama skipped some abortion votes, saying her \u201clast-minute smears\u201d won\u2019t protect the right to choose.   Meanwhile, Republicans <a class=\"legacy-link\">John McCain</a> and Mitt Romney traded blows again yesterday.   Polls show the race is close, although McCain \u2013 who won here in 2000 \u2013 has built momentum in recent weeks.   \u201c[Romney] has changed his position on almost every major issue,\u201d McCain said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d   McCain has hammered Romney for shifting his positions on abortion, immigration and Iraq.   When asked about charges of flip-flopping at a Fox News Channel debate in Manchester last night, Romney said, \u201cI\u2019m not the only person at the table who\u2019s changed his position on an issue.\u201d <em>Additional reporting by Carl Campanile and Kenneth Lovett in New Hampshire</em><em><a class=\"a10blb\" href=\"mailto:geoff.earle@nypost.com\">geoff.earle@nypost.com</a></em>"
