Topic modeling utilizes unsupervised machine learning in order to discern multiple topics within a corpus of documents. In this case, it identifies subtopics within the documents of a user selected topic. It uses the Latent Dirichlet allocation model that finds topics across a set of all the words and then assigns documents to topics percentage wise. Topic modeling brings up themes within a set of documents and in this case, it can be compared between the New York Times and New York Post to understand their differences in how they cover major social issues.
