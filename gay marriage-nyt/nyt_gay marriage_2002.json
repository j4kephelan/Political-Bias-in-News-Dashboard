    "2002 - 306": "The contentious battle over gay marriage, previously fought in distant Hawaii and rural Vermont, will move into the New Jersey court system on Wednesday, when a national gay rights group plans to file a lawsuit in state court here on behalf of seven same-sex couples who have been denied marriage licenses.",
    "2002 - 482": "Justice Minister Martin Cauchon, left, said the government would appeal a decision by a lower Ontario provincial court earlier this month to extend marriage rights to homosexual couples. Mr. Cauchon said there was no consensus among the general population or in the courts for the society to automatically take such a large step. The Ontario court has given the federal Parliament two years to change laws in order to give homosexuals equal partnership rights. Clifford Krauss (NYT)",
    "2002 - 557": "Gays and lesbians scored a legal victory when the Constitutional Court rejected a complaint by some conservative-governed states that argued that gay marriages contradicted family values enshrined in the Constitution.

Their relationships are officially called ''registered life partnerships'' rather than marriages and the law gives couples rights in areas like inheritance and health insurance. Victor Homola (NYT)"
