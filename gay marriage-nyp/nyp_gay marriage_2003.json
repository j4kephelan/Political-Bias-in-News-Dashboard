    "2003 - 703": " Nicole Kidman has finally emerged to quash the nagging rumors that her marriage to Tom Cruise was a complete sham.  \u201cLook, the marriage was real. The marriage existed because it was two people in love \u2013 it\u2019s that simple,\u201d the flame-haired stunner tells the December issue of Vanity Fair.  And Kidman, 35, insists that she, unlike her ex-hubby, couldn\u2019t care less about the constant speculation she\u2019s a lesbian and he\u2019s gay.  \u201cThey\u2019ve said I\u2019m gay. They\u2019ve said everyone\u2019s gay. I personally don\u2019t believe in doing huge lawsuits about that stuff. Tom does.\u201d she says.  \u201cI have a different approach. I don\u2019t file lawsuits because I really don\u2019t care. Honestly, people have said everything under the sun.\u201d ",
    "2003 - 1317": "An upbeat First Brother Jeb Bush said yesterday he\u2019d hit his stride at just the right time as he cast his ballot for re-election as Florida governor with polls showing him headed for a big win that would leave Democrats glum.   Democratic challenger Bill McBride shrugged off polls that had him behind much as 16 points and hugged voters as he cast a ballot with his wife, saying: \u201cWe\u2019ve got two sure votes here.\u201d   Democratic National Chairman Terry McAuliffe had put Jeb Bush at No. 1 on his 2002 hit list, vowing to beat him and get revenge for the 2000 Florida election fiasco that that resulted in victory for Jeb\u2019s brother, George W. Bush.   Team Bush used every possible asset to protect Florida, sending in Vice President Dick Cheney, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and former Mayor Rudy Giuliani to court voters in the final days.   On the eve of the vote, Democrats yelled foul when they caught voters getting recorded phone calls from a GOP firm that claimed Bush backed \u201ctraditional families\u201d but McBride favored gay marriages.   Bush, blitzing the state aboard the 737 jet of billionaire Wayne Huizenga, heard about the calls and ordered that they stop immediately.   A Republican consultant with ties to the Christian Coalition said \u201cI screwed up\u201d and forgot to clear the script with Florida GOP officials. ",
    "2003 - 4908": " Pitching quiz show here.Alleges tryst with butler.Shocking new revelations of gay rape, servant orgies and a sinister cover-up are rocking the royal family, further damaging the tarnished crown.  The latest bombshells come hot on the heels of blabbermouth butler Paul Burrell revealing scores of intimate royal secrets.  Burrell, Princess Diana\u2019s butler and closest confidante, has laid bare Di\u2019s battles with bulimia, the bitter fight over her funeral and the unraveling of her fairy-tale marriage.  He\u2019s currently holed up at a Times Square hotel with his family and trying to pitch a game show to American TV networks.  Now, a former royal valet has come forward to claim he was the victim of homosexual rape carried out by a senior member of Prince Charles\u2019 staff \u2013 and that Charles covered up the sickening attack.  George Smith, 42, an ex-army corporal, told the Mail yesterday he informed Diana of the brutal attack and she made a tape of his harrowing account.  Smith said he was raped by a high-ranking, unidentified aide after falling unconscious during a boozing session at the man\u2019s London home in 1989.  \u201cI woke up. I was hurting,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI was totally ashamed. I felt sick. He was just laughing . . . as if he knew that he had got his way with me and that I could not do anything about it.  \u201cHe was much more influential and powerful than me at the palace.\u201d  Smith\u2019s father hinted that the attack has devastated his son, who turned to booze for solace as his marriage unraveled.  \u201cMy son has been getting his life back together and this publicity has brought all his problems back,\u201d said his dad, who wouldn\u2019t give his name.  During Burrell\u2019s aborted trial, it was revealed that Diana had a cassette tape containing details of the alleged rape. The princess clandestinely conducted the interview with Smith at his hospital bedside.  But the tape has disappeared from a locked chest in Kensington Palace and has never been found.  The accused rapist, who remains on Charles\u2019 staff, denied the claim, as does the palace.  The accused man insisted the sex romp was consensual, and in a letter released by his lawyers yesterday, blasted Smith as \u201can unreliable alcoholic\u201d whose latest charges differed \u201csubstantially and significantly\u201d from those he made to police last year.  At the time of the alleged rape, Charles assured Diana that the disturbing charges were simply \u201cdownstairs gossip.\u201d But Smith was nonetheless given about $59,000 in hush money.  Diana was encouraged to forget the matter, but she could not and even visited Smith at the London hospital where he was being treated for depression.  She tucked the tape away with other ammunition that may have proven helpful in her war with the royals.  Her \u201cwar chest\u201d also reportedly included insulting letters her fearsome father-in-law, Prince Philip, wrote to her dismissing her as a \u201ctrollop and a harlot\u201d \u2013 and telling her she should \u201cput up with\u201d Charles\u2019 affair with Camilla Parker Bowles.  A close pal of Di\u2019s, faith healer Simone Simmons, revealed that the princess was devastated by Philip\u2019s words but apparently resigned to her fate, saying the palace felt it could treat her any way it wished now that it had its \u201cheir and the spare.\u201d  \u201cShe used those exact words \u2013 I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Simmons said.  It is likely that Queen Elizabeth intervened in Burrell\u2019s theft trial when it appeared such dirty laundry was going to be revealed, royal watchers say.  The explosive allegations are fueling conspiracy theories, including those of Mohamed al-Fayed, the father of Di\u2019s dead boyfriend, Dodi.  Al-Fayed has always believed the palace played a sinister role in the fiery car crash that killed Di and Dodi in Paris in 1997.  He claimed yesterday his theory has been bolstered by the queen herself, who allegedly warned Burrell that there were \u201cdark powers\u201d at work.  \u201cIt now seems quite clear that Burrell\u2019s trial was stopped by those mysterious \u2018powers\u2019 who wanted at all costs to prevent him from revealing royal secrets,\u201d the Harrods owner said.  Two investigations had been conducted into the first rape charge and another alleged attempted attack involving the same pair in 2001, but the probes were stopped by the director of public prosecutions. A separate inquiry concluded the inquiries had been handled \u201clamentably.\u201d  Detectives were also apparently \u201cbemused\u201d by Charles\u2019 determination to protect the alleged attacker. He raced back to Britain on Saturday after a sojourn in Italy to try and contain the damage that again threatens the beleaguered monarchy.  Last night, constitutional experts were huddling with Charles to try and determine the extent of the damage to the House of Windsor.  Meanwhile, ABC News has acquired the U.S. broadcast rights to \u201cDiana\u2019s Rock,\u201d a documentary on Burrell that aired in Britain last night. It will air on \u201c20/20\u201d Nov. 18 and on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d from Nov. 18 to 22.",
    "2003 - 2334": "<strong>H</strong>ERE\u2019S a pop quiz suitable for Leona Helmsley fans and foes alike:  1. Which much-younger man romanced the billionairess, hinted at marriage, then got himself hired to run the Helmsley hotel empire?  2. Which younger Romeo was fired after working for Leona a grand total of three weeks?  3. Having lost the plum gig, which younger master-of-all-things-Leona is now suing his former love interest for $9 million? On the grounds that \u2013 are you ready? \u2013 she fired him because he no longer wanted to sleep with her!  Well, it\u2019s not Patrick Ward, who served as Helmsley\u2019s employee and boyfriend \u2013 until she found out that Ward had a boyfriend, too.  And it isn\u2019t Charles Bell, the former drug-loving hotel manager who cried \u201cgay bias!\u201d after Leona canned him.  There\u2019s a new entrant in the fast-growing sue-Leona sweepstakes. This one\u2019s called J. Roger Watkins, whose goofy suit was filed Feb. 20 in White Plains federal court.  Watkins, 52, is no stranger to intimate moments with Leona. As The Post\u2019s Cindy Adams reported in 2000, Watkins was, at that time, dating the widow, 30 years his senior. He said he wanted to marry her. Until his mother objected.  Watkins\u2019 exit left a void that was rapidly filled by one Patrick Ward. He was not only Leona\u2019s boyfriend, she named him chief operating officer of Helmsley Enterprises. That is, until his little gay secret came out.  Ward sued her, then settled for a reported $1 million. Not a bad payday for a few months\u2019 work.  After the Ward fiasco, Watkins came back. Leona made him CEO, on Dec. 14, 2001, according to his lawsuit.  Then she fired him on Jan. 7, 2002, he claims, because he refused \u201cto continue to engage in verbal and physical conduct of a sexual nature with Helmsley.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s not similar to the Patrick Ward situation,\u201d Watkins\u2019 lawyer, Scott Steiner, insisted. \u201cHe worked for her. There was nothing he was seeking that was extraordinary.\u201d  Leona is in Florida. She\u2019s wiped out from last month\u2019s trial involving Charles Bell, who lied on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and handed out free rooms to pals, then won an $11 million gay-bias verdict. This week, a judge reduced the ridiculous award to $554,000.  I wish there were a cap on the number of lawsuits that can be filed by losers who want to tap into an old lady\u2019s wealth. I fear these suits will be the death of Leona. ",
    "2003 - 1940": "The gay lover of a man killed in Midtown last year by alleged hit-and-run madman Ronald Popadich has won an unprecedented court decision that allows him to sue a city hospital as the slain pedestrian\u2019s \u201cspouse.\u201d   According to the ruling by a Nassau County Supreme Court judge, state courts will recognize the civil union that John Langan, 42, and the late Neal Spicehandler underwent in Vermont in November 2000.   That gay marriage, which took place in the only state to perform such same-sex rites, came nearly a year and a half before the 43-year-old Spicehandler died in the February 2002 auto rampage, in which the New Jersey man allegedly mowed down 25 people over two days.   Langan has filed suit against St. Vincents Medical Center, alleging Spicehandler\u2019s care after the wreck was negligent and reckless. Langan argued he was eligible for compensation as a bereaved spouse.   The ruling by Justice John P. Dunne allows Langan\u2019s suit against St. Vincents to proceed.   It is the first time a court anywhere in America has treated a gay couple joined in Vermont as a traditional married couple, said Adam Aronson, a lawyer for LAMBDA, a gay civil-rights group that represented Langan.   The Catholic hospital tried to get the case thrown out of court by arguing that men\u2019s gay union was a \u201cnarrow circumstance\u201d that allowed for an exception to the federal doctrine of \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d between states, which usually requires states recognize each other\u2019s laws.   But Dunne disagreed, ruling that New York must recognize the union as it recognizes other non-traditional pairings from other states, such as common-law marriages.   \u201cIt is impossible to justify, under equal-protection principles, withholding the same recognition from a union which meets all the requirements of a marriage in New York but for the sexual orientation of the partners,\u201d the judge wrote in his decision released yesterday.

    "2003 - 2167": " WASHINGTON \u2013 New York City\u2019s interests are being hurt by the \u201cconservative junta\u201d in power in Washington, Council Speaker Gifford Miller charged yesterday.  In unusually harsh language at a private congressional breakfast in Washington, Miller used the term \u201cjunta\u201d to describe Republicans who he charged are worsening the city budget crisis, according to participants at the meeting.  Miller\u2019s comments about a \u201cjunta\u201d \u2013 which suggests an unelected military ruling clique \u2013 jarred some Republican staffers, who questioned the wisdom of stridently bashing the GOP when it calls most of the shots in Washington.  \u201cIt\u2019s not real good politics to attack Republicans when they are in charge,\u201d noted an aide to a New York Republican lawmaker who was at the breakfast where Miller first spoke.  Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) also took issue with Miller, insisting that Republicans have been good to New York on some fronts, including recently earmarking $2.2 billion in the stimulus bill for the city and state.  \u201cI give the administration some credit. Overall, the news from Washington is not that bad,\u201d Schumer said.  Miller later told The Post, \u201cThere is in fact a very well-organized conservative movement in this country that is seeking to defund the entire federal government and federal programs.\u201d  The speaker\u2019s remarks came as he led a council delegation to Washington for an unusual hearing to review the city\u2019s budget crisis and the federal government\u2019s response to it.  Many New York lawmakers, including Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-Manhattan) and Eliot Engel (D-Bronx), are angry that Republicans in Congress have refused to hold a follow-up hearing to examine how New York is faring 17 months after 9/11.  \u201cThe majority in Congress want to sweep everything under the rug,\u201d charged Engel.   The council also delivered a package listing the goals it would like to see accomplished in Washington this year, including more federal aid and repealing the Defense of Marriage Act, which is viewed as anti-gay.  \u201cThere is, in fact, a very well-organized conservative movement in this country that is seeking to defund the entire federal government and federal programs.\u201d",

    "2003 - 2730": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Gay sex is protected under the U.S. Constitution, the Supreme Court ruled yesterday in a 6-3 decision that pleased gay-rights advocates and angered social conservatives.  \u201cThis is an historic day for fair-minded Americans everywhere,\u201d said Elizabeth Birch, director of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay-rights group.  But conservative activist Ken Connor said the decision \u201cthrows the door open to any sexual behavior.\u201d  On the last day of its term, the court said a Texas law banning gay sex violated privacy rights under the Constitution.  The court\u2019s ruling will make it much more difficult for any state to regulate what consenting adults may or may not do in their bedrooms.  Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority, said gay people \u201care entitled to respect for their private lives.\u201d  With the sodomy issue settled, gay-rights advocates predict there will now be more focus on the issue of same-sex marriage, with all eyes on an upcoming Massachusetts state Supreme Court decision on whether it\u2019s unfair to let men and women legally wed, but ban gay couples from doing so.  \u201cThe issue of marriage for gay couples is going to come to the forefront,\u201d said David Smith, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign.  Connor, of the Family Research Council, angrily agreed, saying, \u201cThe radical homosexual lobby will seek to apply the logic [of yesterday\u2019s decision], extending a blanket privacy protection over one\u2019s choice of sexual partner to one\u2019s choice of marital partner as well.\u201d  Justices John Paul Stevens, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer agreed with Kennedy\u2019s opinion, while Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor agreed with the outcome of the case but would have decided it on different constitutional grounds.  Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas disagreed with the decision.  \u201cThe court has largely signed on to the so-called homosexual agenda,\u201d Scalia wrote, adding that the majority ruling \u201ccoos\u201d over a gay-rights agenda.  \u201cThe court has taken sides in the culture war, departing from its role of assuring, as neutral observer, that the democratic rules of engagement are observed,\u201d Scalia said.  Scalia read from a dissenting opinion that, at 21 pages, was longer than the court majority\u2019s 18-page ruling.  There were murmurs from some in the courtroom crowd as Scalia railed for more than seven minutes against what he called a hypocritical ruling that runs roughshod over democratically elected legislatures.  \u201cMany Americans do not want persons who openly engage in homosexual conduct as partners in their business, as scoutmasters for their children, as teachers in their children\u2019s schools or as boarders in their home,\u201d Scalia wrote."
