    "2013 - 4648": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Washington National Cathedral, where the nation gathers to mourn tragedies and celebrate new presidents, will soon begin hosting same-sex marriages.Cathedral officials tell The Associated Press the church will be among the first Episcopal congregations to implement a new rite of marriage for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender members. The church will announce its new policy Wednesday.As the nation\u2019s most prominent church, the decision carries huge symbolism. The 106-year-old cathedral has long been a spiritual center for the nation, hosting presidential inaugural services and funerals for Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his last sermon there in 1968. The cathedral draws hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.In light of the legality of same-sex marriage in the District of Columbia and now Maryland, the Rt. Rev. Mariann Edgar Budde, the Episcopal bishop of Washington, decided in December to allow an expansion of the Christian marriage sacrament. The diocese covers the district and four counties in Maryland. The change is allowed under a \u201clocal option\u201d granted by the church\u2019s General Convention, church leaders said. Each priest in the diocese can then decide whether to perform same-sex unions.The Very Rev. Gary Hall, the cathedral\u2019s dean, said performing same-sex marriages is an opportunity to break down barriers and build a more inclusive community \u201cthat reflects the diversity of God\u2019s world.\u201d\u201cI read the Bible as seriously as fundamentalists do,\u201d Hall told the AP. \u201cAnd my reading of the Bible leads me to want to do this because I think it\u2019s being faithful to the kind of community that Jesus would have us be.\u201dCelebrating same-sex weddings is important beyond the Episcopal Church, Hall said. Church debate is largely settled on the matter, allowing for local decisions, he said. The move is also a chance to influence the nation.\u201cAs a kind of tall-steeple, public church in the nation\u2019s capital, by saying we\u2019re going to bless same-sex marriages, conduct same-sex marriages, we are really trying to take the next step for marriage equality in the nation and in the culture,\u201d Hall said.Hall is the 10th dean of the cathedral and began serving there in October 2012. He has been an ordained minister for more than 35 years. He said he has long been an advocate for gay marriage and began performing same-sex blessings in 1990 when he served at All Saints Church in Pasadena, Calif.The Human Rights Campaign, the nation\u2019s largest gay rights group, applauded the cathedral\u2019s change Wednesday as a milestone.\u201cToday, the church sent a simple but powerful message to LGBT Episcopalians \u2014 you are loved just the way you are, and for that we embrace you,\u201d said the Rev. MacArthur Flournoy, the deputy director of HRC\u2019s religion and faith program.Gay weddings will be allowed immediately. But It will likely be six months to a year before the first marriages are performed due to the cathedral\u2019s busy schedule and its pre-marital counseling requirement. Generally, only couples affiliated with the cathedral will be eligible. Church leaders had not received any requests for weddings ahead of Wednesday\u2019s announcement.While Hall does not expect any objections within the National Cathedral congregation, he said the change may draw criticism from outside. It may be divisive for some, just as it was to preach against segregation or to push for the ordination of women, Hall said.The New York-based Episcopal Church is the U.S. body of the 77 million-member Anglican Communion. The House of Bishops voted last year 111-41 to authorize a provisional rite for same-sex unions. Some congregations have left the church over its inclusion of gays and lesbians over the years.Same-sex marriage is now legal in nine states and the District of Columbia. Legislators in Illinois and Rhode Island are set to take up bills to possibly join them, and the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear cases on gay marriage in March.The first same-sex wedding performed last month at West Point\u2019s Cadet Chapel drew some protests from conservatives. The National Cathedral is even more visible.Hall, the cathedral dean, said the church has a long history of taking stands on public issues. But he said he sees marriage as a human issue, not a political issue.\u201cFor us to be able to say we embrace same-sex marriage as a tool for faithful people to live their lives as Christian people,\u201d he said, \u201cfor us to be able to say that at a moment when so many other barriers toward full equality and full inclusion for gay and lesbian people are falling, I think it is an important symbolic moment.\u201d",
    "2013 - 2924": "The evangelical pastor chosen to give the benediction at President Barack Obama\u2019s inauguration withdrew from the ceremony Thursday after remarks he made two decades ago condemning the gay rights movement surfaced.The Rev. Louie Giglio of Passion City Church in Atlanta said in a statement he withdrew because it was likely that the \u201cprayer I would offer will be dwarfed by those seeking to make their agenda the focal point of the inauguration.\u201dAddie Whisenant, a spokeswoman for the Presidential Inaugural Committee, said the committee had chosen Giglio because of his work to end human trafficking.\u201cWe were not aware of Pastor Giglio\u2019s past comments at the time of his selection and they don\u2019t reflect our desire to celebrate the strength and diversity of our country at this inaugural,\u201d Whisenant said in a statement.The liberal website ThinkProgress posted audio of the sermon Wednesday. In the talk, which the pastor said he gave 15 or 20 years ago, Giglio cited Scripture and called same-sex relationships sinful and an abomination. He warned congregants about what he called the \u201caggressive agenda\u201d for acceptance of the \u201chomosexual lifestyle.\u201d And he recommended the writings of an advocate for therapy that aims to convert gays and lesbians into heterosexuals. Repeatedly in the sermon, Giglio urged congregants to welcome gays and lesbians to the church and said God loves them.In Thursday\u2019s statement, Giglio said \u201cspeaking on this issue has not been in the range of my priorities in the past 15 years.\u201dObama\u2019s inaugural planners have put an emphasis on reflecting diversity in the festivities, including the participation of conservative Christians and gay Americans. Obama personally selected Richard Blanco, whose work explores his experience as a Cuban-American gay man, as the inaugural poet. And the Lesbian and Gay Band Association of St. Louis was one of the first selections to march in the inaugural parade.An inaugural official said the Presidential Inaugural Committee vetted Giglio. But their statement said they didn\u2019t know about that particular sermon. Whisenant said the committee was considering others to deliver the benediction at the Jan. 21 event.Ross Murray, the faith program director for the gay advocacy group GLAAD, urged the committee to choose someone for the role who reflects \u201cthe growing sentiment in the U.S. and in faith communities that LGBT people are full and equal parts of society.\u201dObama faced a similar uproar in 2009, when he chose prominent pastor Rick Warren to give the inaugural benediction as an olive branch to evangelicals, who overwhelmingly vote Republican. Warren had compared gay relationships to incest and pedophilia. He had also urged congregants at his Saddleback Church in California to support the Proposition 8 ban on gay marriage on the 2008 state ballot. Despite pressure from gay rights advocates for Warren to bow out, the pastor gave the benediction.",
    "2013 - 6170": "MINNEAPOLIS \u2014 Pauline Friedman Phillips, who under the name of Abigail Van Buren, wrote the long-running \u201cDear Abby\u201d advice column that was followed by millions of newspaper readers throughout the world, has died. She was 94.Publicist Gene Willis of Universal Uclick said Phillips died Wednesday after a long battle with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.Phillips\u2019 column competed for decades with the advice column of Ann Landers, written by her twin sister, Esther Friedman Lederer. Their relationship was stormy in their early adult years, but later they regained the close relationship they had growing up in Sioux City, Iowa.The two columns differed in style. Ann Landers responded to questioners with homey, detailed advice. Abby\u2019s replies were often flippant one-liners.Phillips admitted that her advice changed over the years. When she started writing the column, she was reluctant to advocate divorce:\u201cI always thought that marriage should be forever,\u201d she explained. \u201cI found out through my readers that sometimes the best thing they can do is part. If a man or woman is a constant cheater, the situation can be intolerable. Especially if they have children. When kids see parents fighting, or even sniping at each other, I think it is terribly damaging.\u201dShe willingly expressed views that she realized would bring protests. In a 1998 interview she remarked: \u201cWhenever I say a kind word about gays, I hear from people, and some of them are damn mad. People throw Leviticus, Deuteronomy and other parts of the Bible to me. It doesn\u2019t bother me. I\u2019ve always been compassionate toward gay people.\u201dIf the letters sounded suicidal, she took a personal approach: \u201cI\u2019ll call them. I say, \u2018This is Abby. How are you feeling? You sounded awfully low.\u2019 And they say, \u2018You\u2019re calling me?\u2019 After they start talking, you can suggest that they get professional help.\u201dAsked about Viagra, she replied: \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful. Men who can\u2019t perform feel less than manly, and Viagra takes them right off the spot.\u201dAbout working mothers: \u201cI think it\u2019s good to have a woman work if she wants to and doesn\u2019t leave her children unattended \u2014 if she has a reliable person to care for them. Kids still need someone to watch them until they are mature enough to make responsible decisions.\u201dOne trend Phillips adamantly opposed: children having sex as early as 12 years old.\u201cKids grow up awfully fast these days,\u201d she said. \u201cYou should try to have a good relationship with your kids, no matter what they do.\u201dThe woman known to the world as Ann Landers died in June 2002. Later that year, the family revealed that Phillips had been diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. By then Phillips\u2019 daughter, Jeanne Phillips, who had helped her mother with the Dear Abby column for years, was its sole author.Pauline Esther Friedman, known as Popo, was born on Independence Day 1918 in Sioux City, Iowa, 17 minutes after her identical twin, Esther Pauline (Eppie.). Their father was a well-off owner of a movie theater chain. Their mother took care of the home. Both were immigrants from Russia who had fled their native land in 1905 because of the persecution of Jews.\u201cMy parents came with nothing. They all came with nothing,\u201d Phillips said in a 1986 Associated Press interview. She recalled that her parents always remembered seeing the Statue of Liberty: \u201cIt\u2019s amazing the impact the lady of the harbor had on them. They always held her dear, all their lives.\u201dThe twins spent their growing-up years together. They dressed alike, they both played the violin, they wrote gossip columns for their high school and college newspapers. They attended Morningside College in Sioux City. Two days before their 21st birthday, they had a double wedding. Pauline married Morton Phillips, a businessman, Esther married Jules Lederer, a business executive and later founder of Budget Rent-a-Car. The twins\u2019 lives diverged as they followed their husbands to different cities.The Phillipses lived in Minneapolis, Eau Claire, Wis., and San Francisco, and had a son and daughter, Edward Jay and Jeanne. Esther lived in Chicago, had a daughter, Margo, and in 1955 she applied for and was given the job of writing the advice column. She adopted the existing column\u2019s name, Ann Landers.Pauline, who had been working for philanthropies and the Democratic Party, followed her sister\u2019s lead, though she insisted it wasn\u2019t the reason for her decision. She arranged for an interview with an editor of the San Francisco Chronicle and presented sample columns, arguing that the paper\u2019s lovelorn column was boring. The editors admired her breezy style, and she was hired.Searching for a name for the column, Pauline chose Abigail from the Bible and Van Buren from the eighth American president. Within a year she signed a 10-year contract with the McNaught Syndicate, which spread her column across the country.\u201cI was cocky,\u201d she admitted in 1998. \u201cMy contemporaries would come to me for advice. I got that from my mother: the ability to listen and to help other people with their problems. I also got Daddy\u2019s sense of humor.\u201dPauline applied for the advice column without notifying her sister, and that reportedly resulted in bad feelings. For a long time they did not speak to each other, but their differences were patched up. In June 2001, the twins, 83, attended the 90th birthday party in Omaha, Neb., of their sister Helen Brodkey.The advice business extended to the second generation of the Friedmans. Phillips had announced in 2000 that her daughter would share her byline. Her sister\u2019s daughter, Margo Howard, wrote an advice column for the online magazine Slate.Aside from the Dear Abby column, which appeared in 1,000 newspapers as far off as Brazil and Thailand, Phillips conducted a radio version of \u201cDear Abby\u201d from 1963 to 1975 and wrote best-selling books about her life and advice.In her book \u201cThe Best of Abby,\u201d Phillips commented that her years writing the column \u201chave been fulfilling, exciting and incredibly rewarding. \u2026 My readers have told me that they\u2019ve learned from me. But it\u2019s the other way around. I\u2019ve learned from them. Has it been a lot of work? Not really. It\u2019s only work if you\u2019d rather be doing something else.\u201d",
    "2013 - 777": "PARIS  \u2014 Topless women activists have pounded a huge church bell in Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris to \u201ccelebrate\u201d the pope\u2019s resignation.The nine women from Ukrainian feminist group Femen had their chests and backs emblazoned with the words \u201cPope No More.\u201d They didn\u2019t explain their action except to say they are \u201cprovocateurs\u201d celebrating Pope Benedict XVI\u2019s decision to step down.At one point the women rang an enormous bell on display in the hall of the landmark cathedral, part of a set of new bronze bells cast for Notre Dame\u2019s 850th anniversary this year. Cathedral staff turned off the church lights and pulled the women away.The women say they\u2019re also protesting in support of gay marriage. France\u2019s lower house of parliament is voting Tuesday on whether to legalize it.",
    "2013 - 1059": "Those naughty dames!A group of militant feminists yesterday cheered on the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI by marching topless outside \u2014 and later, for a brief moment, inside \u2014 the famed Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.The nine chanting women \u2014 members of the hard-core Ukrainian protest group FEMEN \u2014 had slogans written in black paint across their bare chests and backs that read, \u201cPope no more\u201d and \u201cGame over.\u201dAt one point, the group managed to get inside the famed French church and ring a massive bell on display there. But Notre Dame workers quickly yanked the breast-baring rebels outside again.The women said they were protesting what they called the church\u2019s continued stance against equal rights for women and gays.The topless troupe noted that France\u2019s lower parliamentary house was poised to vote on whether to legalize gay marriage. The French assembly later approved the measure. FEMEN has defended its trademark shirts-off antics in the past by stating, \u201cIf we staged simple protests with banners, then our claims would not have been noticed.\u2019\u2019",
    "2013 - 430": "DALLAS \u2014 Ex-First Lady Laura Bush wants to be removed from a pro-gay-marriage group\u2019s national ad campaign.A Bush spokesman said she \u201cdid not approve of her inclusion\u201d in the Respect for Marriage Coalition ads that feature a CNN clip of her saying, \u201cWhen couples are committed to each other and love each other, then they ought to have the same sort of rights that everyone has.\u201dThe coalition didn\u2019t immediately comment yesterday.",
    "2013 - 7290": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Citing the principle of equality that drove the nation\u2019s founding, President Barack Obama spoke out Friday against California\u2019s ban on gay marriage and said the Supreme Court should strike it down.A day after his administration filed a friend-of-the-court brief unequivocally calling on the justices to strike down California\u2019s Proposition 8 ballot measure, Obama said he felt there was no way for his administration to avoid the case.\u201cI felt it was important for us to articulate what I believe and what this administration stands for,\u201d the president said.The nation has gone through the same evolution he has gone through about how gay couples should be treated under the law, said Obama, who once opposed gay marriage but changed his position last year during his re-election campaign.\u201cI think this is a profoundly positive thing,\u201d Obama said in a White House news conference.The administration\u2019s brief outlined a broad legal argument that could ultimately be applied to other state prohibitions across the country, but stops short of the soaring rhetoric on marriage equality Obama expressed in his inaugural address in January.Still, it marks the first time a U.S. president has urged the high court to expand the right of gays and lesbians to wed.Obama said the brief didn\u2019t explicitly argue that gay marriage should be made legal in every state because the case before the court deals specifically with California.\u201cThat\u2019s an argument that I make, personally,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThe court may decide that if it doesn\u2019t apply in this case, it probably can\u2019t apply in any case. There no good reason for it.\u201dThe brief is not legally binding, though the government\u2019s opinion could carry weight with the Supreme Court when it hears oral arguments on Proposition 8 in late March.California is one of eight states that give gay couples all the benefits of marriage through civil unions or domestic partnership but don\u2019t allow them to wed. The brief argues that in granting same-sex couples those rights, California has already acknowledged that gay relationships bear the same hallmarks as straight ones.\u201cThey establish homes and lives together, support each other financially, share the joys and burdens of raising children, and provide care through illness and comfort at the moment of death,\u201d the administration wrote.The brief marks the president\u2019s most expansive view of gay marriage and signals that he is moving away from his previous assertion that states should determine their own marriage laws. Obama, a former constitutional law professor, signed off on the administration\u2019s legal argument last week following lengthy discussions with Attorney General Eric Holder and Solicitor General Donald Verrilli.In a statement following the filing, Holder said \u201cthe government seeks to vindicate the defining constitutional ideal of equal treatment under the law.\u201dObama\u2019s position, if adopted by the court, would likely result in gay marriage becoming legal in the seven other states: Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon and Rhode Island.In the longer term, the administration urges the justices to subject laws that discriminate on sexual orientation to more rigorous review than usual, as is the case for claims that laws discriminate on the basis of race, sex and other factors.The Supreme Court has never given gay Americans the special protection it has afforded women and minorities. If it endorses such an approach in the gay marriage cases, same-sex marriage bans around the country could be imperiled.Despite the potentially wide-ranging implications of the administration\u2019s brief, it still falls short of what gay rights advocates and the attorneys who will argue against Proposition 8 had hoped for. Those parties had pressed the president to urge the Supreme Court to not only overturn California\u2019s ban, but also declare all gay marriage bans unconstitutional.Still, marriage equality advocates publicly welcomed the president\u2019s legal positioning.\u201cObama again asserted a bold claim of full equality for gay Americans, this time in a legal brief,\u201d said Richard Socarides, an attorney and advocate. \u201cIf its full weight and reasoning are accepted by the Supreme Court, all anti-gay marriage state constitutional amendments will fall, and quickly.\u201dThe National Organization for Marriage, a leading supporter of the California ban, rejected Obama\u2019s arguments. Spokesman Thomas Peters said he expects the Supreme Court to uphold the votes of more than 7 million Californians to protect marriage, spokesman Thomas Peters said.The president raised expectations that he would back a broad brief during his inaugural address on Jan. 21. He said the nation\u2019s journey \u201cis not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law.\u201d\u201cFor if we are truly created equal, than surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well,\u201d he added.Obama has a complicated history on gay marriage. As a presidential candidate in 2008, he opposed the California ban but didn\u2019t endorse gay marriage. He later said his personal views on gay marriage were \u201cevolving.\u201dWhen he ran for re-election last year, Obama announced his personal support for same-sex marriage but said marriage was an issue that states, not the federal government, should decide.Public opinion has also shifted in support of gay marriage in recent years.In May 2008, Gallup found that 56 percent of Americans felt same-sex marriages should not be recognized by the law as valid. By last November, 53 percent felt they should be legally recognized.Gay marriage supporters see the Supreme Court\u2019s hearing of Proposition 8, as well as a related case on the Defense of Marriage Act, as a potential watershed moment for same-sex unions.In a well-coordinated effort, opponents of the California ban flooded the justices with friend-of-the-court briefs in recent days.Among those filing briefs were 13 states, including four that do not now permit gay couples to wed, and more than 100 prominent Republicans, including GOP presidential candidate Jon Huntsman and Florida Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen.Two professional football players who have been outspoken gay rights advocates also filed a brief in the California case. Minnesota Vikings punter Chris Kluwe and Baltimore Ravens linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo urged the court to rule in favor of same-sex marriage.The Supreme Court has several options to decide the case that would be narrower than what the administration is asking. The justices also could uphold the California provision, as opponents of gay marriage are urging.One day after the Supreme Court hears the California case, the justices will hear arguments on provisions of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as between a man and a woman for the purpose of deciding who can receive a range of federal benefits.The administration abandoned its defense of the act in 2011, but the measure will continue to be federal law unless it is struck down or repealed.In a brief filed last week, the government said Section 3 of the act \u201cviolates the fundamental constitutional guarantee of equal protection\u201d because it denies legally married same-sex couples many federal benefits that are available only to legally married heterosexual couples.",
