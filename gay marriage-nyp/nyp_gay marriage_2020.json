    "2020 - 3444": "Scandal-scarred former Rep. Aaron Schock has come out as gay \u2014 admitting it has left him disowned by his deeply religious family who want him to go through conversion therapy.\u201cI am gay,\u201d wrote the 38-year-old ex-Illinois pol who resigned from Congress five years ago amid claims he <a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://nypost.com/2016/11/10/feds-indict-ex-congressman-who-had-downton-abbey-office/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">misused government and campaign funds</a>, with federal charges only <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/03/06/feds-drop-charges-against-aaron-schock-for-misusing-taxpayer-campaign-funds/\">dropped last year</a>.\u201cFor those who know me and for many who only know of me, this will come as no surprise,\u201d admitted Schock, who noted there was plenty of \u201cspeculation\u201d while he was in office.\u201cIn many ways I regret the time wasted in not having done so sooner,\u201d he said. \u201cLife is better with nothing to fear or hide.\u201dSchock made his public declaration in a <a href=\"https://aschock.net/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">heartfelt, 2,097-word missive</a> that attacked the \u201carray of false charges\u201d and \u201cyears-long struggle to clear my name.\u201dIt showed he was still smarting over the claim that he misused money to <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2015/02/23/politician-used-campaign-money-on-private-jets-massages-and-a-katy-perry-concert/\">decorate his office with a \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d</a> theme \u2014 \u201ca show I\u2019d never even heard of, and still haven\u2019t seen,\u201d he insisted.Schock wrote of how being brought up in the Apostolic Christian Church left him initially trying to deny his sexuality \u2014 then being disowned by his family once finally out.\u201cI understood that the teachings of my upbringing were pretty clear on the matter,\u201d he said of being gay, saying he avoided thinking about it.Once in office, he says, he \u201cassumed that revealing myself as their gay congressman would not go over well.\u201d\u201cI also, in retrospect, realize that I was just looking for more excuses to buy time and avoid being the person I\u2019ve always been,\u201d he admitted.The probe into his finances also included \u201cprying\u201d into his personal life, he says, quipping, \u201cUnfortunately for prosecutors, the most sensational thing they learned about my personal life was that I didn\u2019t have much of one.\u201dWhen he was finally ready to confide in his family last Easter, photographs that emerged of him shirtless with other men at the Coachella festival \u201cmade clear\u201d that he was gay, he wrote.When he spoke to his mother, \u201cshe told me to turn around and go back to LA. I wasn\u2019t welcome at home for Easter,\u201d he wrote.\u201cWhat I had to share was unwelcome news to every single person in my family, out of the blue in some cases, and was met with sadness, disappointment, and unsympathetic citations to Scripture,\u201d he said.\u201cIt hurt to hear all this, to say the least. What I had feared from many of them had come to pass,\u201d he said, saying he knows some might \u201cnever come around.\u201d\u201cI still get occasional emails trying to sell me on conversion therapy,\u201d he said of his family \u2014 while sharing hope after his mother said she would like to meet \u201canyone special\u201d in his life.While defending himself against all the charges made against him, Schock admitted to one clear regret \u2014 being against gay marriage while in office.\u201cI can live openly now as a gay man because of the extraordinary, brave people who had the courage to fight for our rights when I did not,\u201d he wrote.",
    "2020 - 38357": "One of the many things this pandemic has taken from us is the chance to comfort the grieving. For now, at least, we can\u2019t attend a funeral Mass or gravesite, or visit the homes of friends and family members who\u2019ve suddenly, shockingly lost someone they loved. As of Monday, there were 4,758 coronavirus-related deaths in New York state, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/04/05/nyc-coronavirus-death-toll-now-at-2472-with-almost-65k-cases/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2,738 of them from NYC alone</a>. In New Jersey, there have been 1,003 fatalities, and 206 in Connecticut.\u00a0The plague doesn\u2019t discriminate. In the past three weeks, it\u2019s taken firefighters and social workers, Holocaust survivors and classic-car collectors, doctors and drag performers, parents and priests. Each will be missed.In time, we\u2019ll be able to hug one another again. For now, all we can do is recall their lives through the eyes of those who\u2019ve known them best: family, friends and colleagues.Here are just a handful of the many people we\u2019ve lost. May their good works live after them, inspiring us all to be our best, most compassionate selves in their honor.About six years ago, vasculitis stole Preschel\u2019s eyesight. But it didn\u2019t lessen her passion to serve: Hardly a day went by when she wasn\u2019t at Helping Hands, the Teaneck food pantry she co-founded in 2008.And when Preschel died last week at Teaneck\u2019s Holy Name Medical Center, a victim of the coronavirus, a community mourned.\u201cShe had her disability, but it never stood in her way,\u201d recalls Paul Ostrow, the former Teaneck mayor who says Preschel used to \u201cpressure\u201d him to join her beloved Rotary Club, though he hadn\u2019t the time. \u201cShe was a catalyst \u2014 the kind of person who wanted to involve others to help her do good, too.\u201dNeighbors recall her as a doting aunt of seven nieces and nephews, and the unrelated but committed kin of what seems to be most of Teaneck, where the Massachusetts native spent roughly half her life.\u201cAlmost everybody called her Aunt Janice or Aunt J,\u201d says her sister-in-law, Claire Preschel, with whom she lived after she was blind. \u201cShe was a big Teaneck youth-sports fan \u2014 soccer, wrestling, football, volleyball \u2014 before she lost her sight and after.\u201dNot only was Preschel the director of the food pantry, says Rotary Club president Danielle Richards, but the former social worker served on several community boards and her synagogue\u2019s social action committee. \u201cShe was very kind, always smiling, and she had a wicked sense of humor,\u201d Richards says. \u201cShe loved Teaneck. She knew everything that was going on in town.\u201d Richards says their last conversation was at the hospital. \u201cShe told me how exhausted the nurses were in the ICU, and how they couldn\u2019t cook, so what could we do? So we thought of purchasing them gift cards, helping them and the local businesses still open for takeout and delivery.\u201dPreschel died on March 30. The next day, Teaneck\u2019s town manager \u2014 whom Preschel had addressed at the Rotary Club weeks ago about COVID-19 \u2014 ordered all town flags flown at half-staff.And those gift cards for overworked nurses? By then, Richards says, the Rotary had raised more than $1,100 for Preschel\u2019s final act of charity.<em>The Rev. Vincenzo Cardilicchia, 48, remembers his mentor Ortiz-Garay, who passed away March 27.</em>\u201cWhen you become an ordained priest, you discover there are so many things that you didn\u2019t learn in seminary. Your mentor shapes the way you relate with people, and Father Jorge was my mentor. I learned a lot from him when I was taking my first steps into the priesthood. Father Jorge was very close to everyone and very easygoing. He visited families\u2019 homes in the afternoon into the night. People would seek him out for guidance \u2014 not just to receive a word from God, but also for counseling. He had the charisma of a leader and he was always available. He helped me not just be a clerical, institutionalized priest, but as Pope Francis says, to be a shepherd living with the smell of the sheep.\u201d<em>Carney\u2019s son, NYPD officer Tom Carney, 41, remembers his father, who passed away March 27.</em>\u201cIf there was one thing about my dad that people remember, it was his presence. He was a big guy with a big voice. To know him was to love him, but even if you didn\u2019t know him, he would make sure you at least heard him. He was in many ways larger than life. A tough Marine, but a gentle soul.\u201cMy dad was the most quick-witted person I\u2019ve ever known. He could find the most witty response to any situation, and immediately put all present at ease. His sense of humor was legendary, and I was always jealous of his ability to remember so many jokes. He had a joke for everything. Even if the joke wasn\u2019t that funny or you\u2019ve heard him say it a hundred times, his own laughter that followed his jokes would force even the most aloof of people to chuckle.\u201cI\u2019ve been told that this unique sense of humor made him beloved by all during his 35-year career as a court officer in Queens Family Court \u2014 a place that can often be depressing and chaotic. One esteemed judge recently told my mother that his efficiency and upbeat attitude made her job there that much easier.\u201cThe same can be said about his other job, working security for Fashion Week. His professionalism, tactfulness and, of course, sense of humor were mainstays at the shows for 25 years. Everyone who encountered him, if even only once, remembers and respects him. I\u2019d say that speaks volumes to the character of my dad.\u201cI would not know what it feels like to be the son of a celebrity, but I\u2019d be willing to bet it\u2019s similar to being the son of Tommy Carney. Whenever I was introduced to someone who knew my dad, the look and subsequent handshake (or hug) I would receive would fill me with an immense sense of pride. But it was no surprise to me. I always knew my dad was the greatest.\u201cOf any job my father ever had, the one he took most pride in was papa to his six wonderful grandchildren. His face would just light up whenever he saw them, as would theirs when they saw him. His love and pride in them was unmatched. I can take comfort in knowing that his life on Earth was filled with so much love, both given and received. He will greatly be missed.\u201dGeremia loved her family, her Catholic faith and Frank Sinatra, though not necessarily in that order.\u201cGrowing up, I knew every [Sinatra] song, every word,\u201d Theresa Apostolo says of her mother, who died Sunday at Dry Harbor Nursing Home &amp; Rehabilitation Center in Middle Village. \u201cShe had him on the stereo all the time and had his pictures all over the house. She even saw him a few times.\u201dThe Manhattan native went to Catholic schools and, at 20, married her childhood sweetheart, Joseph, who died in 2003. They raised four children together in Queens.\u201cShe was a little rough around the edges, but she cared deeply for her children,\u201d Apostolo says. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t touch us! She was a big momma bear, believe me, and was not one to mess with .\u2009.\u2009. But she had a good heart. If someone saw something in her wall unit they liked, like a curio or statue, she\u2019d say, \u2018Here, take it.\u2019\u2009\u201dIn later years, she suffered from dementia, sparing her the knowledge that one of her sons had died of a heart attack.\u201cShe used to tell me, \u2018When I go, make sure my white gown and heels are on and my Frank Sinatra records are playing at the funeral parlor!\u2019\u2009\u201d Apostolo says.She promises to follow her mother\u2019s wishes.\u201cI\u2019m the last of the Mohicans,\u201d Birenbaum liked to say \u2014 one of very few remaining survivors of the Holocaust. On March 29, the longtime Howard Beach resident died of COVID-19. He was 93.Until his final days, says family friend Steven Kief of Irvington, NY, his mind was as sharp as ever.\u201cHe was a neighbor of my family\u2019s in the small town of Radom, Poland,\u201d says Kief, 72. \u201cKarl\u2019s father owned a sawmill and got my father and uncle jobs. When [the Nazis] started taking everyone, they hid in the woods .\u2009.\u2009. It\u2019s crazy to think about what they endured and how something like this is taking him.\u201dKief, whose parents and uncle died years ago, calls the former Bulova watchmaker \u201cthe connection to my roots.\u201d He says Birenbaum helped organize a society for the people from Radom and their descendants, and kept it going through two generations. Every Sunday before Yom Kippur, families gathered at a cemetery for a memorial service for the 6 million Jews lost in the Holocaust. \u201cKarl would always bring something to eat after,\u201d Kief says. \u201cHoney cake, spongecake .\u2009.\u2009. He\u2019d set up these little tables for all those goodies.\u201dHe also appreciated women, Kief says of Birenbaum, whose wife died about five years ago. \u201cHe\u2019d always hug a little close, and he loved my wife, Cindy. \u2018How\u2019s my girlfriend doing?\u2019 he\u2019d say. And she loved him, too. He was a character \u2014 straightforward, honest and direct.\u201dThe Birenbaums had no children of their own, and their nieces and nephews live in Canada and Israel. \u201cThey set up a funeral [March 30] through Zoom,\u201d Kief says. \u201cYou know, his birth name wasn\u2019t Karl, it was Kaddish,\u201d the prayer traditionally said for the dead. \u201cThe irony was, they couldn\u2019t say Kaddish for him because they didn\u2019t have a minyan.\u201d<em>Wooden, who passed away on March 23, is remembered by his friend, fashion designer Geoffrey Mac, 43.</em>\u201cNashom was my best friend. He was a beautiful, beautiful man, and talented in so many ways. He was writing songs, he was working on a bunch of reality shows \u2014 and stuff was coming up for him as he was changing careers from being a successful drag performer [known as Mona Foot]. He was very guarded and had this fortress of protection around him \u2014 but when you scaled those walls, he was the most caring man, and he was so supportive. In February, right after I came back from winning \u2018Project Runway,\u2019 we held a dinner in the East Village .\u2009.\u2009. I\u2019m really camera shy and I have social anxieties, but he had talked me into doing the show. I fought against my fears and I won. He started crying, saying I was his hero. Together we shared laughter and so many songs. He really had that fire.\u201d<em>Lea Vischio, 56, remembers her father, who passed away on March 30.</em>\u201cYou could call my dad the mayor \u2014 everyone knew him. He was very dedicated to the St. Ann\u2019s Church community in Dongan Hills, and he was an extremely proud Korean War Air Force veteran. He always wore his baseball cap with the veterans\u2019 patch, and people would thank him for his service. He was active in community theater and dressed up as Santa every year. Newspapers were also his life. He didn\u2019t just read The Post every day \u2014 he was a longtime New York Post pressman, beginning in 1966. My fondest memory is going to the plant, then on South Street in Manhattan, to visit. Whenever my dad was with us kids there, everyone treated us really well and gave us hats made of newspaper. He would have ink on his hands from working the machines, and when he saw a paper that didn\u2019t look right he\u2019d say, \u2018Ah, somebody messed up the prints!\u2019 He was high up in the New York Newspaper Printing Pressmen\u2019s Union, and he was very proud of that. He really was a personality.\u201d<em>Jennifer James, 38, of Cedar Grove, NJ, remembers her father, who passed away March 28.</em>\u201cMy dad never missed anything important. My way of connecting with him was through sports. I got cut from the basketball team in ninth grade and he suggested I start running, so I did that \u2014 and by senior year, I was a varsity all-star track athlete. At my meets, he wasn\u2019t the kind of parent that would sit on the bench with the other parents. He went to watch me perform. During one big race, I went out and ran really fast, and then at the last half mile I fell behind and couldn\u2019t believe it was happening. After, I remember sitting on the bumper of his Volvo with him, crying, and he said, \u2018Hey, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019 He was the only one I wanted to see when I failed. He was always there.\u201d<em>Artist Andrea McKenna, 49, of Jersey City, remembers her friend Rodriguez, who passed away April 1.</em>\u201cJavi and I met at a craft fair in Jersey City in 2010, and we became best friends. She loved live music \u2014 live music and dance parties were her thing \u2014 and she was a huge art lover. Between 2014 and 2017, we ran the Raven Gallery &amp; Boutique in Jersey City, with only handmade items from local artists, including jewelry she designed. I am a decorative painter, and we pushed and encouraged each other creatively.\u201cJavi was also a social worker at a high school in East Rutherford. One young person she helped out was gay and his parents kicked him out, and he became homeless for a while. She encouraged him to push forward, and she found the right resources to help him. Years later, he came back and thanked her. She heard a lot of those stories, and I told her, \u2018You have to remember you helped them make it.\u2019\u2009\u201dAs far as Steiner was concerned, Yankee Stadium was heaven on Earth. The longtime journalist and retired public relations director, who died March 30, was born in The Bronx, and he never stopped rooting for his home team.\u201cHe\u2019d go to the games by himself as a little boy since it was walking distance from home,\u201d says Andrea Steiner, one of his two children. She says her dad majored in history at Columbia University, earning both a master\u2019s degree and a lifelong love of his subject. \u201cHe would read these gigantic hardcover history books on the subway,\u201d she says. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t just a history buff. He was a history expert.\u201dThat was far from his only interest, she says. He loved travel and foreign languages \u2014 he taught himself Portuguese \u2014 and his love of classical music inspired his son, David, to become a musician. He was also crazy about cats. \u201cWhen he was a little boy, my grandparents couldn\u2019t find him for hours,\u201d Andrea says. \u201cFinally, they found him in the basement of the building, because the super had cats.\u201d She says he liked to name the family\u2019s cats after food \u2014 hence, Muffin and Pudding.But his greatest legacy, his daughter says, was his morality.\u201cHe had a sense of right and wrong,\u201d says Andrea. \u201cHe taught me to be responsible. He was so honest.\u201dEven in his earliest days at the all-girls Mary Louis Academy in Jamaica Estates, Queens, Lewinger had a reputation for being gracious and supportive.\u201cHe was just a kid out of college when I first met him,\u201d former student Jacqueline Giaccio, 36, recalls of the beloved basketball coach-turned-assistant principal. \u201cHe was figuring out the temperature of the school, and a lot of teen-angsty female students \u2014 not an easy job.\u201dTributes continue to pour in for Lewinger, who died March 28, leaving behind his wife, Maura, their three children \u2014 and countless current and former students who, Giaccio says, called him Buddy Lew.In addition to everything else, he was a gentleman: \u201cHe held every door, made sure we got home safely and took his wife on one of their first dates to my senior prom,\u201d she says. \u201cI kept in touch with him to tell him about my growing career, and he always took the time.\u201dIn August, emergency room doctor Gabrin married Arnold Vargas \u2014 \u201cthe love of his life,\u201d says friend Debra Vasalech Lyons.On March 31, Gabrin died in Vargas\u2019 arms.\u201cHe was ecstatic to get married. He was starting a chapter in his life,\u201d says Lyons, a friend of Gabrin\u2019s for 20 years and a witness at his City Hall wedding. \u201cIt was the happiest Frank had ever been .\u2009.\u2009. They were caring for each other, planning on children \u2014 the whole picket-fence thing. This was it.\u201dGabrin, a two-time cancer survivor, was also a \u201cworkaholic,\u201d Lyons adds \u2014 but in a good way.\u201cHis whole mission in life was to put the care back in health care. He got into health care to help people,\u201d she says. That included his colleagues. \u201cFrank was the doctor who brought lunch to everyone he worked with.\u201dGabrin, who worked at East Orange General Hospital, will leave an indelible mark on his loved ones, says Lyons.\u201cFrank faced death every day and it didn\u2019t stop him from caring and making things better \u2014 and now we have to tell ourselves the same thing.\u201d\u201cLaw &amp; Order: SVU\u201d cast and crew members last week <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2020/03/27/mariska-hargitay-ice-t-mourn-law-order-crew-member-who-died-from-coronavirus/\">mourned the loss</a> of their revered costumer \u2014 but creating costumes was hardly Wallwork\u2019s only talent.As his mom, Deborah Wallwork, recalls, her son played just about every instrument in his Arizona school\u2019s orchestra, except the trumpet and trombone.But he found his greatest passion early, when he learned to sew at the age of 5. \u201cHe would sit at my sewing machine and run stuff through the machine,\u201d she says. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t making anything, but he just loved it.\u201dAfter taking design and art classes in his early 20s, he moved to Houston and served as the costumer for the city\u2019s renowned opera house. Even so, his mother says, he longed to live elsewhere.\u201cHe wanted to go to New York forever,\u201d she says. About four years ago, Josh moved to the place he\u2019s always wanted to be, working for \u201cLaw &amp; Order\u201d and \u201cMadam Secretary.\u201d\u201cNew York embraced him,\u201d says Deborah. \u201cHe loved working on the shows. He said, \u2018This job is the greatest.\u2019\u2009\u201d\u201cWhen people see a Hasidic man with a beard, they think he\u2019s provincial. But my father was a Renaissance man,\u201d says Brocha Metzger of her dad, the longtime rebbe of the Manhattan Day School yeshiva. Heber, who passed away Thursday, April 2, \u201calways had a stack of books.\u201dThe father of four and a great-grandfather, Heber \u201calways loved exploring the world, as knowledge goes,\u201d says Metzger. \u201cHe took us to museums. \u2018Stay hungry for knowledge, always grow your mind\u2019 were his mantras, and his passions were endless.\u201cHe was a quiet guy. He was happy to stay home and listen to classical music. He had thousands of classical music CDs in alphabetical order, and God help anyone who messed it up.\u201dBut he\u2019d broaden his musical repertoire during the summer, when he and his family took trips upstate to Bungalow Colony.\u201cHe\u2019d sing \u2018100 Bottles of Beer on the Wall,\u2019 and a crazy collection of songs,\u201d Metzger says. \u201cHe was such a fun-loving guy \u2014 the king of road trips.\u201dFDNY mechanic Villecco was a serious car guy.\u201cHe loved classic cars,\u201d says his wife, Joy. \u201cHe was a Chevy guy. He loved his 1960s Chevy Impala.\u201d He even founded a car show at Tottenville High School in 2016, and it was \u201chis pride and joy.\u201dJimmy was also an Army man, she says, and a fierce patriot.\u201cWhen the national anthem played, my Jimmy cried,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of man he was. He was American through and through.\u201dBut the most important thing in his world was family: his wife of 19 years and their 18-year-old daughter, Jessica. Jimmy even sold his beloved Impala to help pay for Jessica\u2019s upcoming college tuition.\u201cHis family was his life,\u201d says Joy, who sang their wedding song to him, \u201cRibbon in the Sky\u201d by Stevie Wonder, as he was fighting for his life in the hospital.A few months ago, Joy and Jimmy went to New Jersey\u2019s Bradley Beach together, to find the gazebo where he proposed 20 years ago.\u201cHe wanted to go back and find the spot \u2014 we took a picture,\u201d says Joy.\u201cWhatever we did, we took those special moments for us. He was always there for us. God gave me a good man.\u201d Villecco died March 28.Born in Kazakhstan and relegated to a displaced persons camp in Germany, Erlich arrived in the US at age 9 and became a true New Yorker.\u201cHe loved going to the theater,\u201d says his daughter, Jordana Levine, of her dad, who died on March 28 at 78. She remembers how he\u2019d drive her and her younger brother from their home in Park Slope to see a show, invariably parking their car next to the Private Eyes \u201cgentlemen\u2019s club.\u201dThe former teacher and guidance counselor went into real estate, but his heart, Jordana says, belonged to music: \u201cHe could belt out songs, and he loved the Pointer Sisters.\u201dHe was protective, she says \u2014 so much so that when he was forced to undergo prostate surgery, he didn\u2019t tell her about it until years later. He was also discreet in his generosity.\u201cHe loved doing things for people with no expectation back,\u201d she says. \u201cMy cousin went to private school growing up, and he sent money anonymously for tuition \u2014 without his sister knowing.\u201dAn art history major, he loved going to museums and antique shows, but his greatest love, Jordana says, was for his three grandchildren.Last month, when her youngest boy turned 13, the family decided to postpone his bar mitzvah. That didn\u2019t stop Erlich, who loved to make a joke, from sending his grandson a birthday card gushing about the bar mitzvah that wasn\u2019t. \u201cHe was always teasing,\u201d Jordana says. \u201cBut that was his nature. He had so much love.\u201dFreeman was a hard woman to say no to.\u201cShe was very persuasive,\u201d recalls Sylvia Pfeffer, with whom the longtime Montclair, NJ, resident ran an educational consulting service. \u201cWe were going to a conference in New Mexico in 2001, and she was looking through the brochure and said, \u2018They have balloon rides! Write a check, we\u2019re going!\u2019 \u201d When Pfeffer demurred, Freeman, then 78, persisted.\u201c \u2018Yes, you are!\u2019 she said,\u201d Pfeffer recalls. \u201cI was so happy I did.\u201dFreeman died March 24. Pfeffer says her friend and business partner became an activist in her teens, when she petitioned the Board of Education to add Hebrew to the French and Spanish language classes at her Bronx high school.\u201cAnd she got them to do it, too,\u201d Pfeffer says.A Hunter College graduate and mother of two, Freeman helped found the Montclair Cooperative School in 1963.

That her street remained diverse more than half a century later meant a great deal to her, Pfeffer says.\u201cHer neighbors on Stephen Street still wish she were there.\u201dHelmreich\u2019s claim to fame is that <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/03/31/ccny-professor-who-walked-nearly-every-nyc-block-dies-of-coronavirus/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">he walked every block in New York City</a>.To his family, though, the former <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2016/09/24/why-one-man-walked-all-800-miles-of-brooklyn/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Manhattanite\u2019s pedestrian wanderings</a> \u2014 which led to almost 20 books, including \u201c<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/New-York-Nobody-Knows-Walking-ebook/dp/B00F8MIIP4?tag=nypost-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://nypost.com/2020/04/06/the-new-yorkers-lost-to-coronavirus/&amp;asc_source=web\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The New York Nobody Knows: Walking 6,000 Miles in the City</a>\u201d \u2014 was just one marker of the sociologist\u2019s intrepid spirit.\u201cWhen we got married in 1970, he said to me, \u2018We could either do a honeymoon in France or up in the Catskills \u2014 or you could come with me to Haiti.\u2019 I chose to go with him to Haiti,\u201d says his novelist wife, Helaine, 73.\u201cIt was always an adventure. It was a wonderful adventure,\u201d says Helaine of her 50-year marriage to the longtime City College of New York professor, who died on March 28 at their home in Great Neck.He often invited loved ones on his urban ramblings. Son Joe Helmreich, a 37-year-old novelist who lives on the Upper West Side, recalls a summer 2019 jaunt to Queens that included a stop at \u201ca beautiful hand-carved carousel\u201d in Forest Park as well as \u201cthe childhood homes of famous athletes and jazz singers\u201d in St. Albans\u2019 Addisleigh Park enclave.

A fixture on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday nights, his best-known song at the showtunes spot was \u201cPoor Unfortunate Souls\u201d from \u201cThe Little Mermaid.\u201d\u201cLadies, ladies \u2014 and the two gentlemen who are here,\u201d the kindly blunt singer would begin, bemoaning that \u201cwe used to be a gay bar!\u201dCastelli was born in The Bronx in 1969, and later moved with his family to Yorktown Heights. He spent his adult years living in Upper Manhattan, but remained close to his relatives \u2014 especially his nephews and nieces: Anthony, Nicky, JJ, Vinny, Frankie, Trista, Lina and Lilli.\u201cMarc was one of the first people I met when I started working at Marie\u2019s 19 years ago,\u201d said longtime bartender Joseph O\u2019Neill. \u201cHe was a big bear of a guy who loved Broadway, could talk your ear off about it and was an all-around good man.\u201dAlso an actor, Castelli played the role of Edna in a 2013 production of the musical \u201cHairspray.\u201d But it was his performance as a Disney villainess that garnered him international recognition.On a vacation cruise for his 50th birthday in August, two women excitedly approached him.\u201cUrsula!,\u201d they screamed.It wasn\u2019t shocking when Luderer, a special-needs teacher and baseball coach, was diagnosed with the coronavirus: His wife, Brandy, had been diagnosed on March 19 and had a mild case.But his sudden passing on March 30 was a surprise to everyone, as the 30-year-old had no underlying health conditions.Luderer started to notice symptoms a few days after Brandy\u2019s diagnosis.

He loved his family, students, and coaching baseball. In high school, Luderer was a member of the undefeated 2008 Don Bosco Preparatory High School state championship team.\u201cHe was just an all-around happy type of guy,\u201d Brandy says. \u201cHe would go out of his way to cheer someone else up. Every single picture that we have of him, he constantly had a smile on his face. He touched so many lives. He would have helped so many more.\u201dBrandy says that, despite his own diagnosis, Luderer spent his final days checking up on family and friends and making sure that everyone else was OK.\u201cHe was always worried about everyone else.

The Paterson, NJ-born father of four shot to fame with his seven-string guitar, touring with Benny Goodman and playing in Johnny Carson\u2019s \u201cTonight Show\u201d band. When Carson moved the show to California, Pizzarelli stayed in New Jersey, because that\u2019s where his kids were going to school.One of the earliest things John remembers was hearing his father \u201cconstantly practicing\u201d classical guitar, even as a Who\u2019s Who of jazz greats streamed into their home: saxophonist Zoot Sims, guitarist Les Paul and bassist Slam Stewart among them.

He never wanted to miss a plane.\u201dCarrow \u2014 an administrator at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens, and a longtime member of the Communications Workers of America Local 1180 union \u2014 was set to retire at the end of this year.\u201cShe had a countdown clock on her phone,\u201d Keyana Reaves, 29, tells The Post of her mother, who passed away March 30. \u201cWe were looking forward to traveling together.\u201dElmhurst Hospital, where Carrow worked, has become one of the hardest-hit hospitals in New York City. The family says Carrow was self-quarantining due to a possible exposure when she became sick.Reaves, who traveled to New York from Georgia to help take care of her mom\u2019s estate, is in disbelief.\u201cI\u2019ll continue to speak to you and look for your guidance whenever I am lost,\u201d she wrote on Facebook the day after her mother\u2019s passing. \u201cI\u2019m so heartbroken but I know I have to continue to be the strong woman you taught me how to be.\u201dJesdanun was a world traveler and, after discovering running in his 30s, an avid marathoner.

He was also an indie film and craft-beer buff.Cousin Prinda Mulpramook says Nick was the \u201cpicture of health,\u201d with no \u201cunderlying health problems.\u201d He tested positive for the virus on March 22 after feeling sick for around 10 days, according to text messages he sent to his family.\u201cHe did everything he was supposed to do,\u201d Mulpramook tells The Post. \u201cHis condition was improving. He was resting in his apartment in complete isolation. On the 28th, all his vitals were good at his doctor check-up. His lungs were clear.\u201dBut on April 1, Anick told his family he was in bed all day and having a setback.

He died Sunday, March 29, at Mount Sinai Hospital.\u201cHis last gig was on March 13 \u2014 he was downtown, on stage doing his thing,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was 69 acting like he\u2019s 40 years old. I just shot his album cover, because he had a new album coming out.\u201dShe and her stepmother, Joanna Lisanti, are still in shock. They said goodbye to Merrill in the hospital.\u201cHe was very peaceful and sedated on a ventilator, which was shocking to see,\u201d says Laura. \u201cHe had been texting me that morning. I was hugging and kissing him; I didn\u2019t care if I was exposed. When I left the hospital, it was a very long and lonely walk home . . .

He was also a teacher and conductor of the Greater Westchester Youth Orchestra, and was honored by the Met for his service.

His death has sparked worldwide outrage after a photo showing nurses at his workplace using garbage bags as personal protective equipment went viral.\u201cMy brother had a passion for life,\u201d his sister Marya Sherron, of Indianapolis, tells The Post. \u201cMy life will never be the same.\u201dSherron says Kelly was a \u201cdefender of the weak.\u201d \u201cHe had big dreams and was determined enough to live them out,\u201d she adds.Kelly graduated from the New York University nursing program in 2012. Nurses at Mount Sinai previously told The Post that Kelly was \u201clike a brother\u201d and always \u201cwilling to help others in need, especially in this coronavirus outbreak.\u201dKelly\u2019s last words to his sister via text were \u201cI love you.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t talk because I choke and can\u2019t breathe.

A single mother of two boys, she somehow also found the time to teach English to new immigrants at the Washington Heights Y in the \u201960s and early \u201970s.She plunged headlong into politics in 1976, when she became the first woman on the City Council to represent Washington Heights. \u201cSo many people in those days would say to her, \u2018Why aren\u2019t you home taking care of your husband?\u2019 \u201d Scott Stringer recalls. \u201cTo which she said, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t have a husband.\u2019 She was a New York original.\u201dHe credits her with shaping far more than his career. \u201cShe taught my brother and me that public service must be part of life, to do for others,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople say she encouraged me to run, but the truth is, if she had her way, she would have protected us from that public life.\u201dStill, she was no shrinking violet. \u201cShe was tough as nails,\u201d says Stringer. \u201cIn my campaigns, she was like a bulldozer. She looked out for me for every race I ran.\u201dStringer recalls his mother\u2019s final political act was holding a fundraiser in her home two years ago for state Senate candidate Alessandra Biaggi, saying, \u201cMy life as a woman in politics was worth it to see so many young women now running for office.\u201d\u201cShe believed she needed to be a trailblazer for the next generation of women,\u201d adds Stringer.Dr. Ricardo Castaneda was a renowned psychiatrist, but he also found the time to create \u2014 writing crosswords and even operas.Born in Guatemala, Castaneda trained at Albert Einstein Hospital in The Bronx and was the head of in-patient psychiatry at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan before going into private practice.\u201cHe fought for all his patients and rescued countless lives from addiction and mental illness,\u201d his son, software engineer Olivier Castaneda, writes in a Facebook tribute.Oliver says he\u2019ll never forget the most important lessons his dad taught him: to \u201cover-tip, appreciate a good bottle of wine and never to drive too close to the person in front of me.\u201d<em>\u2014 With additional reporting by Hana Alberts, Johnny Oleksinski and Emily Smith</em><strong>The New York Post will continue to pay tribute to the lives lost to the coronavirus.

[But] the people who didn\u2019t vote at all \u2026 that\u2019s when you think, \u2018Man, people think this is a game,\u2019 \u201d she added at another point.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just in this election, but every midterm, every time Barack didn\u2019t get the\u00a0Congress he needed, that was because our folks didn\u2019t show up. After all that work, they just couldn\u2019t be bothered to vote at all. That\u2019s my trauma.\u201dThe former first lady is the subject of the upcoming documentary \u201c<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Michelle-Obama/dp/1524763136?tag=nypost-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://nypost.com/2020/05/04/michelle-obama-lack-of-minority-voters-in-2016-was-slap-in-face/&amp;asc_source=web\">Becoming</a>\u2019\u2019 \u2014 made by the Obamas\u2019 new production arm and of the same name as Michelle\u2019s 2018 autobiography, which is still near the top of the New York Times best-seller list.In the video series, Michelle Obama, 56, adds that she\u2019s glad to be out of the White House \u2014 and has no plans for any political office in the future.\u201cNow we\u2019re out of the White House, not to be viewed, judged and parceled by every other person on the planet \u2014 yeah, it\u2019s better, it\u2019s absolutely freeing,\u2019\u2019 she said.\u201cBeing the first lady has been the greatest honor of my life. But how many people are in that position where the entire attention of everything is you, every gesture you make, every blink of an eye is being analyzed?\u201cBarack and I are not interested in being at the forefront forever \u2014 not even for that much longer,\u2019\u2019 Michelle added, even as Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/01/29/joe-biden-says-hed-want-michelle-obama-to-be-his-running-mate/\">has said he\u2019d love to have her on his ticket</a>.Michelle\u2019s former chief of staff, Melissa Winter, said during the documentary that her ex-boss doesn\u2019t even like politics and had to be \u201cdragged\u201d around Iowa during her husband\u2019s initial presidential campaign.\u201cShe wasn\u2019t crazy about the process, she doesn\u2019t like politics,\u2019\u2019 Winter said.The former first lady recalled a humorous incident during her life in the DC fish bowl, when she wanted to leave the White House with daughter Malia to join the crowds celebrating the enactment of gay marriage legislation in 2015 \u2014 only to find that they couldn\u2019t because the doors were locked. She said she had to shriek at staff to let them out.But she also spoke about the trials of life at the time.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to wake up and maintain that level of perfection that was absolutely required of me and Barack as the first black president and first lady,\u201d Michelle said.\u201cWe act like it doesn\u2019t take a toll on us, but you do not understand what toll it takes on the people around the president.\u201dShe said that being dubbed an \u201cangry black woman\u201d when she first hit the spotlight hurt \u2014 and forced her to stop talking off the cuff.\u201cI had to be much more scripted. I was just waking up to the truth of who we can be, so ready to assume the worst in people,\u2019\u2019 Michelle said.\u201cThe only thing I can do is share that that does hurt \u2026 that changes the shape of a person\u2019s soul.\u201dDiscussing how some Americans \u201creacted with fear\u201d to seeing a black family in the White House, Michelle Obama said, \u201cWhen Barack was first elected, various commentators had naively declared that our country was entering a \u2018post-racial era\u2019 in which skin color would no longer matter.\u201cMany were overlooking the racism and tribalism that was tearing our nation apart.\u201cBarack and I lived with an awareness that we ourselves were a provocation,\u2019\u2019 she said.\u201cWhen you see people gunned down because somebody was so afraid of a kid in a hoodie, that that ended his life \u2026 how were these people dealing with the fact that a black family was in what they perceived was their White House? That was the America that we live in,\u201d she said.Michelle Obama said her future will include mentoring young people.She also has pushed get-out-the-vote efforts since leaving the White House at the end of her husband\u2019s second term in 2016 \u2014 including a new initiative she announced last month amid the coronavirus pandemic.She talked about life as an \u201cempty-nester\u201d now that their daughters, Malia, 21, and Sasha, 18, are at college \u2014 but said it\u2019s a welcome challenge.<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"youtube-player\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zqVUafhQ4xc?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" style=\"border:0;\" title=\"Video\" width=\"640\"></iframe></span>\u201cI want to take care of me, rediscovering my husband.

    "2020 - 3165": "MEXICO CITY \u2013 Lawmakers and government officials in Costa Rica on Wednesday chided fellow politicians trying to delay a landmark gay marriage ruling from taking effect, an effort which ended in a punch-up between members of a leading political party.Costa Rica\u2019s constitutional court <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-costa-rica-lgbt/love-will-prevail-costa-ricas-same-sex-couples-can-marry-in-2020-idUSKCN1NL06T\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">voted in August</a> 2018 to legalize gay marriage, with the ruling to take effect on May 26 of this year.The decision made Costa Rica the first country in socially conservative Central America to recognize that right of same sex couples to marry.On Tuesday, more than 20 lawmakers attempted to introduce a motion to delay the ruling another 18 months, arguing legislators had not had enough time to review the decision because of other issues, including the novel coronavirus.Rights activists, politicians and government officials say the push from conservatives to delay same-sex marriage detracted from efforts to address the pandemic, given the constitutional court has ruled on the matter.\u201cThere are many other issues that we as a country need to resolve, especially in the face of the emergency we are confronting due to the global pandemic,\u201d said Luis Salazar, presidential commissioner for LGBTI population affairs.\u201cIt\u2019s a waste of time in the sense that the issue is \u2026 \u00a0settled,\u201d he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.The dispute came to blows on Tuesday, when deputy David Gourzong of the National Liberation Party (PLN) physically attacked the legal advisor to fellow PLN deputy Gustavo Viales, local media reported.Gourzong <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GourzongDip\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">apologized on Twitter</a> late Tuesday, tweeting: \u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that neither verbal nor physical violence is the way to resolve differences.\u201dLawmakers would need 38 votes in Costa Rica\u2019s 57-member assembly to bring the issue to the top of the agenda, otherwise it is unlikely to be taken up before the May 26 deadline.Enrique Sanchez, Costa Rica\u2019s first openly gay congressman with the center-left Citizens\u2019 Action Party, said there was little chance of conservatives gaining the necessary majority.\u201cIt\u2019s been a shameful spectacle,\u201d he said.\u201cIt gives me peace of mind that this will possibly die from tomorrow, and there will be no going back.\u201dLegalizing gay marriage was a major campaign promise by President Carlos Alvarado Quesada, who took office in 2018.Rights activists fear that reopening the issue could re-ignite the fierce debate that roiled the election.\u201cThe moment the topic is placed on the table again and the (country\u2019s) polarization is exposed, hate speech starts to rise and physical assaults begin,\u201d said Margarita Salas, an LGBT+ rights campaigner and president of the VAMOS political party.\u201cIt seems like a reflection of deep homophobia that, in the midst of a pandemic, they want to reopen these issues.\u201dSame-sex marriage has become increasingly accepted in Latin America, with gay couples allowed to marry in Argentina, Ecuador, Brazil, Colombia, Uruguay and parts of Mexico.",
    "2020 - 2759": "SAN JOSE, Costa Rica \u2014 Costa Rica became the latest country to legalize same-sex marriage early Tuesday when a ruling from its supreme court went into effect ending the country\u2019s ban.Couples held ceremonies \u2014 mostly private due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but some that were broadcast \u2014 to celebrate their unions before judges and notaries after the ban was lifted at midnight.Daritza Araya and Alexandra Quir\u00f3s married just after midnight in an outdoor service performed by a notary wearing a face mask who pronounced them \u201cwife and wife.\u201d Theirs was the first legal gay marriage in Costa Rica and it was streamed live on the internet.Costa Rica is the sixth country in Latin America to legalize same-sex marriage, following most recently Ecuador, which allowed it last year. It is also permitted in some parts of Mexico.Gay equality activist Marco Castillo married his longtime partner Tuesday morning before a judge.\u201cThis is a step in social equality. The fact that Rodrigo and I are able to come marry each other in a court is progress,\u201d Castillo said. \u201cThis drives us to continue other fights for those who have a different sexual orientation.\u201dCastillo had fought for same-sex marriage for years in the courts. He was also recently sanctioned as a notary for conducting the marriage of two women, which was later annulled.President Carlos Alvarado sent a message on state television and social networks, saying, \u201cToday we celebrate freedom, equality and democratic institutions,.The issue took center stage in Costa Rica\u2019s 2018 presidential election after the Inter-American Court of Human Rights issued an opinion that countries like Costa Rica, which had signed the American Convention on Human Rights, had to move immediately to legalize gay marriage.It helped propel President Carlos Alvarado to victory over an evangelical candidate, Fabricio Alvarado, who had campaigned against it.In August 2018, Costa Rica\u2019s supreme court said the country\u2019s ban was unconstitutional and gave the congress 18 months to correct it or it would happen automatically. The Legislative Assembly did not act, so at midnight the law banning same-sex marriage was nullified.A campaign celebrating the change called \u201cI do\u201d planned a series of events including hours of coverage on state television and messages from celebrities, including Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations commissioner for human rights.Gia Miranda, director of the \u201cI do\u201d campaign, said television coverage would also include segments on the movement\u2019s history in Costa Rica.\u201cIt gives us so much joy,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cThe only thing that could win with this is Costa Rica and in general love.\u201d She said it would help decrease discrimination and make the country more prosperous and attractive to tourists.",
