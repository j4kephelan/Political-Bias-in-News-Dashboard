    "2016 - 2737": "The owners of an Oregon bakery who denied service to a same-sex couple have paid more than $135,000 in state-ordered damages \u2013 <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2015/04/26/christian-bakers-face-135k-fine-for-refusing-to-make-cake-for-gay-wedding/\">months after refusing to do so</a> \u2013 according to state officials Monday.Aaron Klein, co-owner of Sweet Cakes, by Melissa, dropped a check off for $136,927.07, according to the Bureau of Labor and Industries. The payment includes interest. Klein also paid $7,000 earlier this month.Damages were awarded in July for emotional suffering caused by the bakery which refused to make a wedding cake for Laurel and Rachel Bowman-Cryer more than two years ago. The bakers said they refused to make the cake because of their religious beliefs.The dispute goes back to January 2013 when Bowman-Cryer came into the shop with her mother for a cake-tasting appointment. However, Aaron Klein told the women that the bakery didn\u2019t do cakes for same-sex weddings. The women filed complaints with the state and triggered a national debate over claims of religious beliefs against anti-discrimination laws.Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian awarded the damages nearly six months ago, saying the owners had violated the women\u2019s civil rights by discriminating on the basis of their sexual orientation. They were also slapped with a gag order that prohibited them from speaking publicly about their refusal to participate in or bake wedding cakes for same-sex marriages.<a name=\"a31106610b6652809461183787f8b994-56757169-81042592\"></a> <script src=\"https://video.foxnews.com/v/embed.js?id=4343227636001&amp;w=466&amp;h=263\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script><noscript>Watch the latest video at <a href=\"https://video.foxnews.com\">video.foxnews.com</a></noscript>\nAaron and his wife Melissa filed an appeal of the ruling and were defying the order to pay the damages before Monday. Tyler Smith, an attorney representing the Kleins, told The Oregonian that his clients have not abandoned their appeal of Avakian\u2019s order. Smith said it was in their clients\u2019 best interests to pay now rather than wait for the appeal date, which is slated for next year.The Oregonian reported the state has received a total of $144,000 from the Kleins. Charlie Burr, an agency spokesman, told the paper the payment might be more than what they owe.\u201cWe have been in touch with their lawyers throughout the process,\u201d Burr said. The amount might differ because of the accruing interest, according to the paper.A 2007 Oregon law protects the rights of gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgender people in employment, housing and public accommodations. The state ruled it also bars private businesses from discriminating against potential customers.",
    "2016 - 3888": "A book to be published in Hong Kong in the new year says Zhou Enlai, Communist China\u2019s much-respected first premier, was probably gay despite his long marriage, and had once been in love with a male schoolmate two years his junior.It is a contention certain to be controversial in China, where the Communist Party likes to maintain its top leaders are more or less morally irreproachable and where homosexuality is frowned upon, though no longer officially repressed.The Hong Kong-based author, Tsoi Wing-mui, is a former editor at a liberal political magazine there who has written about gay-themed subjects before though this is her first book.She re-read already publicly available letters and diaries Zhou and his wife, Deng Yingchao, wrote, including ones that detailed Zhou\u2019s fondness for a schoolmate and emotional detachment from his wife, to conclude that Zhou was probably gay.Zhou was premier from the revolution in October 1949 that brought the Communist Party to power until his death from cancer in 1976, a few months before the death of his revolutionary colleague Mao Zedong, the founder of modern China.Reuters obtained excerpts of the Chinese-language book, called \u201cThe Secret Emotional Life of Zhou Enlai.\u201d It is published by the same house that put out the secret diaries of former Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, who was ousted after 1989\u2019s Tiananmen Square crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators.Tsoi re-read books published by the party in 1998 to mark the 100th anniversary of Zhou\u2019s birth that contained public essays and speeches by Zhou as well as his diary, letters, poems, novels and thesis from 1912 to 1924.\u201cZhou Enlai was a gay politician who had the misfortune of being born 100 years early,\u201d Tsoi writes in her book.She told Reuters the real meaning of the diaries had been hidden in plain sight, but no Chinese scholars had openly made the connection before as the subject of homosexuality was unknown to them.\u201cWhen mainland Chinese authors came into contact with this material, they would not consider the possibility of homosexuality,\u201d she said.It is not illegal to be gay in China and these days many large Chinese cities have thriving gay scenes, although there is still a lot of family pressure to get married and have children, even for gay men and women.There are a handful of openly gay celebrities in China but certainly no politicians say in public they are gay.While Chinese literature and history are rich in their descriptions of relatively liberal attitudes towards homosexuality during imperial times, the revolution brought more prudish attitudes.Tsoi expects the book to be banned in China, where discussion of controversial personal details of senior leaders, especially historically significant ones like Zhou, are off limits.Gao Wenqian, a US-based biographer of Zhou, said he was aware of speculation about Zhou\u2019s sexuality, but it was hard to say for certain if it was true.\u201cThere\u2019s actually not that much information about it in the records,\u201d Gao told Reuters. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to be sure.\u201dThe State Council Information Office, or cabinet spokesman\u2019s office, did not respond to requests for comment. The Communist Party History Research Office, reached by telephone, declined to comment.The book says Zhou was most fond of Li Fujing, a schoolmate two years his junior.Zhou wrote in his diary that he could not live one day without Li, the author says in the book, and being with Li can \u201cturn sorrow into joy.\u201dZhou and Li shared a dormitory from 1917 and \u201ceven their shadows do not part,\u201d she wrote. Li died in 1960.Zhou married Deng Yingchao in 1925. They had no children of their own.There were \u201cno romantic feelings\u201d and it was a \u201cmarriage in name only \u2026 He was never in love with his wife,\u201d Tsoi wrote.Deng, who was chairwoman of a high profile but largely ceremonial advisory body to parliament from 1983-88, died in 1992.",
    "2016 - 2012": "Conservative Judaism is about to get a makeover.Down to roughly 1 million adherents \u2014 having lost one-third of its members over the past 25 years \u2014 the moderate movement has hired a team of marketers to give it a new look.New York\u2019s Good Omen agency is interviewing hundreds of Conservative Jews to get their views on the movement in order to develop a new \u201cposition statement\u201d for the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism.More than just new fonts and graphics for the group\u2019s public messaging, the \u201crebranding is about understanding the experience people have with your product or service,\u201d says Rabbi Steven Wernick, the head of the USCJ\u2019s organizational arm. \u201cAnd we know there is a level of uncertainty about precisely where the \u2018brand\u2019 of Conservative Judaism sits in our members\u2019 lives.\u201dStricter than liberal Reform Jews \u2014 but with few of the lifestyle constrictions associated with Orthodox Judaism \u2014 the Conservative branch is a kind of moderate middle ground.Conservative Jews don\u2019t don modest black ensembles like their Orthodox brethren; they\u2019re also open to lesbian and gay members and even allow same-sex marriage ceremonies. But they don\u2019t sanction intermarriage and recognize only children born from Jewish mothers as Jewish.\u201cIt\u2019s a culturally demanding version of Judaism,\u201d explains Steven M. Cohen, professor of Jewish social policy at the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in New York.Cohen calls the rebranding \u201chelpful,\u201d but isn\u2019t sure it\u2019s enough to attract new congregants \u2014 or stop current ones from defecting.\u201cThe real cause of [community] shrinkage is intermarriage and the decline of ethnic attachment among American Jews,\u201d he says.Wernick says the overhaul has another purpose: it can help reconnect members with the movement\u2019s traditions.\u201cThere\u2019s a sense that Conservative Judaism offers a strong balance between [secular] society and Judaism as a whole,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd this provides for many nuanced opportunities for partnerships and synergies for the movement.\u201d",
    "2016 - 1495": "The chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court ordered the state\u2019s probate judges on Wednesday not to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, despite a <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2015/06/26/supreme-court-approves-gay-marriage-nationwide/\">ruling by the US Supreme Court last year legalizing gay marriage</a>.Chief Justice Roy Moore said the US Supreme Court decision is at odds with <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2015/02/12/federal-judge-in-alabama-orders-county-to-wed-gay-couples/\">earlier opinions by the state\u2019s highest court</a>, resulting in \u201cconfusion and uncertainty\u201d among probate judges.Many of the state\u2019s judges have been issuing marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples since the national ruling, while others refused to do so or stopped issuing licenses to any couples, Moore said.\u201cThis disparity affects the administration of justice in this state,\u201d he said in his administrative order.While the Alabama Supreme Court weighs the issue, probate judges \u201chave a ministerial duty not to issue any marriage license contrary\u201d to the state\u2019s law banning same-sex marriage, Moore said.The effect of Moore\u2019s order was not immediately clear.Gay marriage activists quickly rebuked it, arguing Moore does not have the authority to override higher courts.\u201cChief Justice Roy Moore today issued a dead letter,\u201d said Scott McCoy, a senior staff attorney for the Southern Poverty Law Center. \u201cThis is Moore yet again confusing his role as chief justice with his personal anti-LGBT agenda.\u201d",
    "2016 - 1647": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Up against a hostile, Republican-controlled Congress, President Obama is expected to dispense with new proposals requiring congressional approval in his State of the Union Address Tuesday night.The White House has promised a different kind of speech, although it will have all the trappings of prior events, including overdone bonhomie between lawmakers and attention-grabbing guests in the gallery.Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who was jailed last year for refusing to issue marriage licenses to gay couples, is set to attend the speech with her attorney, Mat Saver, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/\">the Washington Examiner reported</a>. The Family Research Council in Washington, DC, arranged for Davis, who spent five days in jail, to attend.Also in the audience will be Obama\u2019s guest James Obergefell, the lead plaintiff in the historic Supreme Court case last year that led to the ruling to legalize gay marriage in all 50 states.In his final State of the Union speech, Obama will host guests important to his rise, such as the South Carolina woman who introduced him to the \u201cFired up, ready to go\u201d slogan on the campaign trail. New initiatives, a staple of past speeches, are likely to be focused on executive orders that the president can issue unilaterally.A chair in the president\u2019s box near first lady Michelle Obama will be left open for victims of gun violence \u2014 as Obama faces lawmakers for the first time since taking executive actions on guns.Obama also plans to conduct interviews Tuesday with three YouTube hosts who have big followings, and will jet to Nebraska and Louisiana to tout his platform.",
    "2016 - 6080": "Donald Trump delivered a one-two punch to Ted Cruz at Thursday night\u2019s GOP debate \u2014 clutching the birther card in one fist while slugging the Texas senator for <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2016/01/13/cruz-slams-trump-for-holding-new-york-values/\">his anti-New York smear</a> with the other.\u201cWho the hell knows if you can even serve in office?\u201d Trump demanded to know of the Canadian-born Cruz during the angriest clash of the campaign between the GOP presidential front-runners.Trump drew boos from the audience at the Fox Business Network-sponsored debate in South Carolina, as he warned that Cruz could be ineligible for the White House, even though his mother is a US citizen.Calling the issue \u201ca big question mark on your head,\u201d Trump declared, \u201cYou can\u2019t do that to the party.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad we\u2019re focusing on the important topics of the evening,\u201d Cruz cracked back, to loud applause.\u201cYou know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had his lawyers look at this from \u00adevery which way, and there was no issue there. There was nothing to this birther issue,\u201d Cruz \u00adresponded.\u201cNow, since September, the Constitution hasn\u2019t changed. But the poll numbers have. And I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa. But the facts and the law here are really quite clear. Under longstanding US law, the child of a US citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen,\u201d he added.Cruz then turned the tables, noting that some birther theories would even disqualify Trump.\u201cSome of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on US soil, but have two parents born on US soil. Interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified, because Donald\u2019s mother was born in Scotland. She was naturalized,\u201d Cruz said to laughter.\u201cOn the issue of citizenship, Donald, I\u2019m not going to use your mother\u2019s birth against you.\u201dTrump suggested that his rival go to court to prove he is a legitimate candidate, prompting more booing from the crowd.Cruz shot back: \u201cI\u2019ve spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the US Supreme Court.

Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and Andrew Cuomo and Bill de Blasio\u201d have asked him to apologize, Cruz told reporters.\u201cI apologize to the millions of New Yorkers who\u2019ve been let down by liberal politicians,\u201d he needled.Then he blasted top New York Democrats by \u201capologizing\u201d to those \u201cdenied jobs because Governor Cuomo won\u2019t allow fracking.\u201dHe \u201capologized\u201d to \u201cAfrican-American children who Mayor de Blasio tried to throw out of their charter schools that were providing a pipeline to the American Dream.\u201dAnd in a final dig at the mayor, Cruz said New York law enforcement and first responders deserve an apology because de Blasio \u201cstands with looters and criminals.\u201d<br/>\nCruz also stood by his \u201cNew York values\u201d slam at Thursday night\u2019s GOP presidential debate.\u201cEveryone understands the values in New York City are socially liberal, are pro-abortion, are pro-gay-marriage, focus around money and the media,\u201d Cruz said.\u201cThere are not a lot of conservatives coming out of Manhattan,\u201d he joked.Cruz\u2019s fusillade came late Friday, after New York elected officials ripped into him for trying to win votes in the Midwest by disparaging New York.\u201cOn behalf of all New Yorkers, I\u2019m disgusted at the insult that Ted Cruz threw at this city and its people,\u201d de Blasio said.Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton tweeted: \u201cJust this once, Trump\u2019s right: New Yorkers value hard work, diversity, tolerance, resilience, and building better lives for our families.\u201d<br/>\nGov.

He should apologize,\u201d said former Mayor Rudy Giuliani.\u201cI thought we had gotten over this prejudicial attitude toward New York after September 11,\u201d said Giuliani, dubbed \u201cAmerica\u2019s Mayor\u201d after guiding the city in the aftermath of the terrorist \u00adattacks.Cruz critics were quick to note how the Tea Party favorite hasn\u2019t been afraid to come to New York to fill his campaign coffers \u2014 although Cruz tends to rely on a nationwide network of small donors more than Wall Street bigs for the vast majority of his funds.\u201cThe next time Senator Cruz is fund-raising in Manhattan, I invite him to come to my district where he can meet real New Yorkers, and maybe then he will think twice about wrongly insulting the integrity of the people I am so proud to call my fellow citizens,\u201d said GOP Rep. Dan Donovan of Staten Island.In the most recent three-month filing period ending in September, Cruz took in $213,455 from the five boroughs.Cruz\u2019s self-serving swipe at New York could soon hurt him where it hurts \u2014 with one prominent New York donor threatening to withdraw his campaign cash.\u201cI want my money back!\u201d mega-donor John Catsimatidis told The Post.Catsimatidis maxed out with a $5,400 contribution to Cruz last year. Now he\u2019s having second thoughts.\u201cI think it was horrible. I think when you\u2019re running for president, you shouldn\u2019t try to separate Americans from different parts of the country,\u201d he said.The supermarket magnate also took issue with Cruz\u2019s comment that New York is all about media and money.\u201cWe\u2019re all about people. We\u2019re all about our country. We\u2019re all about America going forward,\u201d Catsimaditis said.Not every New Yorker was \u00adoffended.\u201cIf I could legally double my money, I would give it to him,\u201d said Marlene Mieske, a donor who has lived in Manhattan for 38 years.She said New Yorkers \u201ccriticize anybody who is not from New York .\u2009.\u2009.
