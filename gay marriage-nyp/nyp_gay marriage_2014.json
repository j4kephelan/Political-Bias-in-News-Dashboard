    "2014 - 4297": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 A Utah lawmaker hopes residents can soon donate to the state\u2019s fight against gay marriage by checking a box on a tax form.Republican Rep. Merrill Nelson of Grantsville has proposed a bill that would give residents the option of donating a portion of their income-tax refund to a \u201cMarriage Defense Fund.\u201d The tax form already allows donations for nine other groups, including a homeless trust fund and one for organ transplants.Nelson said the option is meant to placate proponents of same-sex marriage who complain the state is wasting money appealing a federal decision striking down Utah\u2019s gay marriage ban. It also allows supporters of \u201ctraditional marriage\u201d a way to show their support for the cause, he said.\u201cThis bill really is designed to appease both sides,\u201d said Nelson, who is an attorney for Kirton McConkie, which represents The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.Utah will spend $300,000 to bring in a team of three outside attorneys to help defend the state\u2019s same-sex marriage ban before a federal appeals court. If Utah\u2019s case moves to the U.S. Supreme Court, the costs of hiring the team of private attorneys would be another $300,000, Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes said.On Tuesday, hundreds of opponents and supporters of same-sex marriage held twin rallies at the Capitol. Reyes defended the costs at the rally put on by opponents of same-sex marriage, saying \u201cI do not believe this is a losing case,\u201d to a standing ovation.Brandie Balken, executive director of the gay rights group Equality Utah, criticized the bill, which has been given the title of \u201cMarriage Defense Fund.\u201d She said it would create more division among Utah residents by suggesting the only marriages worth celebrating are opposite-sex unions.\u201cThe title and the language itself is divisive,\u201d Balken said. \u201cIt implies that we are not all invested in the sanctity and importance of marriage.\u201dThe measure is the latest in the battle over the state\u2019s same-sex marriage ban approved by two-thirds of Utah voters in 2004 but overturned by a federal judge in late December. More than 1,000 gay and lesbian couples then married, until the U.S. Supreme Court granted the state an emergency stay Jan. 6, halting the weddings.The Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is reviewing the case, with a ruling expected in a few months.Gov. Gary Herbert ordered state agencies to freeze recognition of same-sex marriages, while the federal government has said they\u2019ll recognize the marriages.Nelson said he\u2019s not aware of any other state that allows people to check a box on a tax form to contribute to a state\u2019s legal fees. He said the idea came to him \u201clike a flash\u201d after hearing the complaints from both sides.\u201cIt seems fair to both sides,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not intended to be at all controversial.\u201dIf Nelson\u2019s measure passes, the tax-refund contributions would come on taxes filed in 2015.The impact might be more ceremonial than practical. The state office of fiscal analysts estimates the Marriage Defense Fund would draw $60,000 over the next two years, based on the math of 2,000 people donating $15 each.The nine causes that people already can contribute refund money to using their Utah state tax form include youth organizations, the homeless, wildlife, pets, organ transplants, schools and even the \u201ccanine body armor account.\u201dAny cause get can get a space on the tax form if the Legislature approves it, Utah Tax Commission Charlie Roberts said. Funds are removed if they receive less than $30,000 for three consecutive years, he said.The nine funds brought in $181,000 in 2013 with contributions from 10,300 people, state tax figures show. Contributions to these funds have steadily dwindled since Utah residents donated nearly $333,300 to them in 2008.The two most popular causes in recent years were the homeless-assistance and organ-transplant funds. People donated $48,800 to help the homeless last year and $37,800 for organ transplants.Nelson\u2019s fund might have a hard time getting through a legislative body where some leaders have suggested it makes sense to wait for the appeals court decision before weighing in on the issue.House Speaker Becky Lockhart said as much Tuesday, but she also said she would stop short of blocking such bills from clearing her chamber.",
    "2014 - 4727": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In an assertion of same-sex marriage rights, Attorney General Eric Holder is applying a landmark Supreme Court ruling to the Justice Department, announcing Saturday that same-sex spouses cannot be compelled to testify against each other, should be eligible to file for bankruptcy jointly and are entitled to the same rights and privileges as federal prison inmates in opposite-sex marriages.The Justice Department runs a number of benefits programs, and Holder says same-sex couples will qualify for them. They include the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund and benefits to surviving spouses of public safety officers who suffer catastrophic or fatal injuries in the line of duty.\u201cIn every courthouse, in every proceeding and in every place where a member of the Department of Justice stands on behalf of the United States, they will strive to ensure that same-sex marriages receive the same privileges, protections and rights as opposite-sex marriages under federal law,\u201d Holder said in prepared remarks to the Human Rights Campaign in New York. The advocacy group works on behalf of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equal rights.Just as in the civil rights struggles of the 1960s, the stakes in the current generation over same-sex marriage rights \u201ccould not be higher,\u201d said Holder.\u201cThe Justice Department\u2019s role in confronting discrimination must be as aggressive today as it was in Robert Kennedy\u2019s time,\u201d Holder said of the attorney general who played a leadership role in advancing civil rights.Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin said Holder\u2019s \u201clandmark announcement will change the lives of countless committed gay and lesbian couples for the better. While the immediate effect of these policy decisions is that all married gay couples will be treated equally under the law, the long-term effects are more profound. Today, our nation moves closer toward its ideals of equality and fairness for all.\u201dHolder\u2019s speech was criticized by the conservative National Organization for Marriage.\u201cThis is just the latest in a series of moves by the Obama administration, and in particular the Department of Justice, to undermine the authority and sovereignty of the states to make their own determinations regulating the institution of marriage,\u201d said Brian Brown, the group\u2019s president. \u201cThe changes being proposed here to a process as universally relevant as the criminal justice system serve as a potent reminder of why it is simply a lie to say that redefining marriage doesn\u2019t affect everyone in society.\u201dOn Monday, the Justice Department will issue a policy memo to its employees instructing them to give lawful same-sex marriages full and equal recognition, to the greatest extent possible under the law.Holder\u2019s address is the latest application of a Supreme Court ruling that struck down a provision in the Defense of Marriage Act defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman. The decision applies to legally married same-sex couples seeking federal benefits.After the Supreme Court decision last June, the Treasury Department and the IRS said that all legally married gay couples may file joint federal tax returns, even if they reside in states that do not recognize same-sex marriages. The Defense Department said it would grant military spousal benefits to same-sex couples. The Health and Human Services Department said the Defense of Marriage Act is no longer a bar to states recognizing same-sex marriages under state Medicaid and Children\u2019s Health Insurance Programs. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management said it is now able to extend benefits to legally married same-sex spouses of federal employees and annuitants.Holder told his audience:\u2014The Justice Department will recognize that same-sex spouses of individuals involved in civil and criminal cases should have the same legal rights as all other married couples, including the right to decline to give testimony that might violate the marital privilege. Under this policy, even in states where same-sex marriages are not recognized, the federal government will not use state views as a basis to object to someone in a same-sex marriage from invoking this right.\u2014The U.S. Trustee Program will take the position that same-sex married couples should be eligible to file for bankruptcy jointly and that domestic support obligations should include debts such as alimony owed to a former same-sex spouse.\u2014 Federal prisoners in same-sex marriages will be entitled to visitation by a spouse, inmate furloughs during a crisis involving a spouse, escorted trips to attend a spouse\u2019s funeral, correspondence with a spouse and compassionate release or reduction in sentence based on an inmate\u2019s spouse being incapacitated.",
    "2014 - 3888": "The Boy Scouts of America said Wednesday that it lost 6 percent of its membership after an often-bruising year in which it announced it would accept openly gay boys for the first time, over the objections of some participants who eventually left the organization.The organization\u2019s national leadership voted in May to accept openly gay boys for the first time, while continuing to exclude gay leaders. That policy change, while lauded by gay-rights groups, angered conservatives and some members who consider homosexuality a sin and a violation of Scouting values.BSA spokesman Deron Smith said Wednesday that the 2013 decline could partially be attributed to that change, but also other issues that have caused slight declines in membership over the last decade.\u201cThere are many factors that go into a family\u2019s decision to join Scouting and it\u2019s impossible to point to any single factor that influences our membership numbers,\u201d Smith said in an email. \u201cThis includes, but is not limited to, the limited amount of discretional time and parents wanting relevant programs for their kids.\u201dWith nearly 2.5 million youth and almost 1 million adults, Scouting remains a significant force in communities across the United States, even though its membership has slowly, but steadily declined over the last decade.The new policy says youths cannot be removed from the ranks of the Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts or Venturers program solely due to sexual orientation. About 60 percent of the 1,400 voting members of BSA\u2019s National Council approved the change at a meeting in the Dallas-Fort Worth suburbs, near BSA\u2019s national headquarters in Irving, Texas.BSA made the change as it faced mounting public pressure in a nation that is growing more accepting of gays and gay marriage. While the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints backed BSA, the Southern Baptist Convention expressed its disapproval and left it to individual churches to decide whether to remain with the Boy Scouts.A small number of Scouts eventually left over disagreements about homosexuality. Some went to Trail Life USA, an organization set up after the change by conservatives and Christian groups. Trail Life claimed about 425 \u201cpre-chartered\u201d groups around the country late last year. It has not said how many youth members it has.BSA, which is a century-old organization, has faced a longer-term challenge to stay relevant with today\u2019s youth and their parents. Smith said the organization recorded a 4 percent membership decline between 2011 and 2012, with similar declines in some of the years during the last decade.He pointed to several successes in 2013 for the Boy Scouts, which opened a new permanent site for its annual jamboree of Scouts from around the world and was featured on a National Geographic television series.\u201cLast year was a milestone year for the BSA in many ways,\u201d he said.He added that accepting openly gay boys \u201callows us to serve more kids.\u201dAlready, one openly gay Scout who was denied his Eagle award due to his sexual orientation has been allowed to achieve Scouting\u2019s highest rank. Pascal Tessier of Kensington, Md., was named an Eagle Scout this week.Zach Wahls, an Eagle Scout who founded the advocacy group Scouts for Equality, said he\u2019s heard of no incidents of potential discrimination since the policy went into effect. He said suggestions last year of a mass exodus due to the policy change appear to have been overblown.\u201cWe believe in the importance of Scouting,\u201d Wahls said. \u201cAnd we look forward to working with the BSA after all this is behind us to look for ways to boost membership again.\u201dBut John Stemberger, Trail Life\u2019s founder, accused the Scouts of hiding the true impact of the policy and predicted BSA would eventually open its doors to gay leaders as well.\u201cThere\u2019s not a whole lot of people that are calling it straight in terms of what the policy is and what it does,\u201d he said.",
    "2014 - 1375": "VATICAN CITY \u2014 Pope Francis on Monday opened the most critical week of his year-old papacy: Two commissions of inquiry on Vatican finance are reporting their recommendations for reform, and preparations get under way for a summit on family issues that will deal with the widespread rejection by Catholics of church teaching on contraception, divorce and gay unions.Francis also will preside over his first ceremony to formally welcome 19 new cardinals on Saturday. In typical Francis style, the cardinals hail from some of the poorest places on earth, including Haiti, Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast.The first half of Francis\u2019 week is devoted to a meeting of his \u201cGroup of Eight\u201d advisers, senior cardinals whom Francis appointed to help govern the church.On Monday, the G8, the pope and his No. 2 heard recommendations from experts on rationalizing the Holy See\u2019s overall financial and administrative structures. On Tuesday, they will hear from the commission of inquiry studying how to reform the Vatican bank.In the second half of the week, cardinals will discuss the October summit, or synod, on family issues.Francis called the synod late last year and commissioned surveys to ask Catholics about church teaching. The surveys found teachings on birth control, homosexuality, marriage and divorce were rejected as unrealistic and outdated by the vast majority of Catholics.",
    "2014 - 2801": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Attorney General Eric Holder said Monday that state attorneys general who believe that laws in their states banning same-sex marriage are discriminatory are not obligated to defend them. For an example, he cited the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education case that led to public school integration.\u201cIf I were attorney general in Kansas in 1953, I would not have defended a Kansas statute that put in place separate-but-equal facilities,\u201d Holder said in an interview with The New York Times.Holder said an attorney general should apply the highest level of scrutiny before reaching a decision on whether to defend laws that touch on core constitutional issues like equal protection. He said the decision should never be political or based on policy objections.\u201cEngaging in that process and making that determination is something that\u2019s appropriate for an attorney general to do,\u201d Holder told the Times for a story that appeared on its website late Monday.Holder was scheduled to address the winter meeting of the National Association of Attorneys General on Tuesday.Democratic attorneys general in five states \u2014 Virginia, Pennsylvania, California, Illinois and Nevada \u2014 have declined to defend same-sex marriage bans against lawsuits filed by gay couples. New Mexico\u2019s attorney general, also a Democrat, has challenged longstanding legal interpretations that said such unions were impermissible there.Republicans have criticized the view that attorneys general can choose not to defend state laws.The Times reported that Holder was careful not to encourage state attorneys general to disavow their own laws. Holder himself refused to defend the federal Defense of Marriage Act in 2011, which helped lead to last year\u2019s Supreme Court decision striking down a key part of the Defense of Marriage Act that denied gay married couples the federal benefits and privileges enjoyed by heterosexual couples.The attorney general has been outspoken on issues he sees as highlighting flaws in the criminal justice system that have a disparate impact on minorities. Earlier this month he called on 11 states to restore voting rights to ex-felons, arguing that laws that permanently disenfranchise people who are no longer under federal or state supervision should be reconsidered.Holder has urged the nation\u2019s schools to abandon disciplinary policies that send students to court instead of the principal\u2019s office, citing cases in which black students were disciplined more harshly and more frequently than whites.In addition, he has instructed federal prosecutors to stop charging many nonviolent drug defendants with offenses that carry mandatory minimum sentences, saying that long mandatory terms have flooded the nation\u2019s prisons with low-level drug offenders and diverted money away from crime fighting.",
    "2014 - 3999": "Arizona\u2019s governor may put the brakes on a controversial bill that would allow businesses to refuse service to gay customers \u2014 amid a backlash that included condemnation from the NFL and Sen. John McCain.Several media organizations Tuesday quoted sources close to Governor Jan Brewer who said the Republican would likely veto Senate Bill 1062.\u00a0The bill would protect businesses who refuse to serve gay or lesbian customers on religious grounds from lawsuits, but has been blasted by opponents as anti-gay.Brewer returned home Tuesday after five days in Washington and has not publicly said whether she would veto the bill. But three sources close to the governor told NBC News Brewer would likely veto it over fears the legislation could hurt the state\u2019s economy.\u201cIt\u2019s been her proclivity in the past to focus on the priorities she wants them [the legislature] to accomplish, and this was clearly not part of her agenda,\u201d longtime Brewer political adviser Chuck Coughlin\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/arizona-bill-controversy/brewer-likely-veto-anti-gay-measure-n38186\">told NBC News</a>.Another source close to Brewer also told NBC the governor \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to take any actions that could jeopardize the economic momentum we\u2019ve seen here in Arizona.\u201dThe NFL, which plans to hold the 2015 Super Bowl in Arizona, stopped short of saying the game could be moved from the state over the legislation, but it said in a statement Tuesday that \u201cOur policies emphasize tolerance and inclusiveness and prohibit discrimination based on age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation or any other improper standard \u2026\u00a0We are following the issue in Arizona and will continue to do so should the bill be signed into law.\u201dSen. John McCain tweeted on Monday, \u201cI hope Governor Brewer will veto #SB1062.\u201dSome Republican senators who pushed the bill through the Legislature are now calling for a veto as well, but they cite \u201cinaccurate\u201d information about the measure for igniting a firestorm. They argue the bill is designed only to protect business owners with strong religious beliefs from discrimination lawsuits that have happened in other states. Some blame the media for blowing the law out of proportion.Democrats say that argument doesn\u2019t wash and call SB1062 \u201ctoxic\u201d legislation that allows discrimination. They said they warned Republicans who voted for the bill that it was destined for trouble.\u201cWe brought this to their attention five weeks ago,\u201d said Sen. Steve Gallardo, D-Phoenix. \u201cWe said this is exactly what is going to happen. You have a bill here that\u2019s so toxic it\u2019s going to divide this Legislature. It\u2019s going to be polarizing the entire state. And that\u2019s exactly what happened.\u201dThe bill was pushed by the Center for Arizona Policy, a social conservative group that opposes abortion and gay marriage. The group says the proposal simply clarifies existing state law and is needed to protect against increasingly activist federal courts.The state\u2019s Super Bowl Committee also weighed into the controversy Tuesday, saying in a statement that a boycott over the bill could hamstring the state\u2019s economy.\u201cOn that matter we have heard loud and clear from our various stakeholders that adoption of this legislation would not only run contrary to that goal but deal a significant blow to the state\u2019s economic growth potential. We do not support this legislation,\u201d the committee said.The NFL moved the 1993 Super Bowl from Tempe, Ariz., to Pasadena, Calif., after voters refused to approve a paid holiday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1990. Arizona voters approved the holiday in 1992, and the NFL held Super Bowl XXX in Tempe\u2019s Sun Devil Stadium four years later.The Arizona bill comes just months before the NFL may draft its first openly gay player.

    "2014 - 4506": "PHOENIX \u2014 Gov. Jan Brewer on Wednesday vetoed a Republican bill that set off a national debate over gay rights, religion and discrimination and subjected Arizona to blistering criticism from major corporations and political leaders from both parties.Brewer\u2019s decision defused a national furor over gay rights and religious freedom.The bill backed by Republicans in the Legislature was designed to give added protection from lawsuits to people who assert their religious beliefs in refusing service to gays. But opponents called it an open attack on gays that invited discrimination.The bill thrust Arizona into the national spotlight last week after both chambers of the state legislature approved it. As the days passed, more and more groups, politicians and average citizens weighed in against Senate Bill 1062. Many took to social media to criticize the bill, calling it an attack on gay and lesbian rights.Prominent Phoenix business groups said it would be another black eye for the state that saw a national backlash over its 2010 immigration-crackdown law, SB1070, and warned that businesses looking to expand into the state may not do so if bill became law.Companies such as Apple Inc. and American Airlines and politicians including GOP Sen. John McCain and former Republican presidential nominee were among those who urged Brewer to veto the legislation.Brewer was under intense pressure to veto the bill, including from three Republicans who had voted for the bill last week. They said in a letter to Brewer that while the intent of their vote \u201cwas to create a shield for all citizens\u2019 religious liberties, the bill has been mischaracterized by its opponents as a sword for religious intolerance.\u201dSB 1062 allows people to claim their religious beliefs as a defense against claims of discrimination. Backers cite a New Mexico Supreme Court decision that allowed a gay couple to sue a photographer who refused to document their wedding, even though the law that allowed that suit doesn\u2019t exist in Arizona.Republican Sen. Steve Yarbrough called his proposal a First Amendment issue during a Senate debate.\u201cThis bill is not about allowing discrimination,\u201d Yarbrough said. \u201cThis bill is about preventing discrimination against people who are clearly living out their faith.\u201dDemocrats said it was a veiled attempt to legally discriminate against gay people and could allow people to break nearly any law and cite religious freedom as a defense.\u201cThe heart of this bill would allow for discrimination versus gays and lesbians,\u201d said Sen. Steve Gallardo, D-Phoenix. \u201cYou can\u2019t argue the fact that bill will invite discrimination. That\u2019s the point of this bill. It is.\u201dThe bill is similar to a proposal last year brought by Yarbrough but vetoed by Brewer, a Republican. That legislation also would have allowed people or religious groups to sue if they believed they might be subject to a government regulation that infringed on their religious rights. Yarbrough stripped that provision from the bill in the hopes Brewer will embrace the new version.Civil-liberties and secular groups countered that Yarbrough and the Center for Arizona Policy, a powerful social conservative group that backs anti-abortion and conservative Christian legislation in the state and is opposed to gay marriage, had sought to minimize concerns that last year\u2019s bill had far-reaching and hidden implications.Yarbrough called those worries \u201cunrealistic and unsupported hypotheticals\u201d and said criminal laws will continue to be prosecuted by the courts.The Center for Arizona Policy argues the law is needed to protect against increasingly activist federal courts and simply clarifies existing state law. \u201cWe see a growing hostility toward religion,\u201d said Josh Kredit, legal counsel for the group.Similar religious-protection legislation has been introduced in Ohio, Mississippi, Idaho, South Dakota, Tennessee and Oklahoma, but Arizona\u2019s plan is the only one that has been passed by a state legislature. The efforts are stalled in Idaho, Ohio and Kansas.The push in Arizona comes as an increasing number of conservative states grapple with ways to counter the growing legality of gay marriage. Arizona\u2019s voters approved a ban on gay marriage as a state constitutional amendment in 2008. It is one of 29 states with such constitutional prohibitions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.Federal judges have recently struck down those bans in Utah, Oklahoma and Virginia, but those decisions are under appeal.",
    "2014 - 3409": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Vice President Joe Biden groused that President Obama gave him \u201cevery s- -t job in the world,\u201d but still doesn\u2019t fully trust him.The revelations about Biden\u2019s tortured relationship with Obama, detailed in a <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/02/joe-biden-profile-103667.html?hp=pm_1#.Uw_OceNdWVo\">lengthy profile by Politico</a>, only got worse when the Veep in 2012 came out in support of gay marriage while Obama was still on the record opposing it.The infamous gaffe, which pre-empted Obama\u2019s announcement that he had \u201cevolved\u201d on the issue and supported gay marriage, so outraged Obama\u2019s top aides that they froze Biden out of White House decision-making meetings.Biden, 71, had agreed early on to take on all the unsavory jobs, from settling Senate spats to cooling out jittery Afghan President Hamid Karzai.But he wanted to be included in the big decisions.\u201cWhen the president asked me what portfolio did I want, I said, \u2018Base it on what you want of me to help you govern,\u2019\u201d Biden recalled telling Obama.\u201c\u2018But I want to be the last guy in the room on every major decision. \u2026 You\u2019re president, I\u2019m not, but if it\u2019s my experience you\u2019re lookin\u2019 for, I want to be the last guy to make the case.\u2019\u201dThe gay gaffe, however, broke the deal.Biden tried to apologize to Obama, telling him he stole the president\u2019s thunder by accident.But Obama\u2019s inner circle held a grudge and became increasingly hostile toward the VP.The slights that followed included barring him from strategic planning meetings, cancelling plans for Biden to headline fundraisers and limiting his public appearances.The Obama aides even interfered with Biden\u2019s staffing decisions, blocking two of his picks for a new chief of staff.Worse yet, they raised the profile of outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who remains Biden\u2019s chief rival for the presidency in 2016.After Obama and Biden won re-election, Obama chose to appear with Clinton, not Biden, in his first TV interview of his second term.After two years, Biden\u2019s fractured friendship with Obama is just starting to mend.Meanwhile, the looming presence of Clinton, 66, has continued to overshadow Biden.The vice president was miffed when top White House aides failed, in his view, to forcefully dispel rumors that Obama was considering replacing him in 2012 with Clinton as VP.Further infuriating Biden, the rumors were true. The Obama campaign had started polling voters about a possible Obama-Clinton ticket.Clinton now leads early polls for the Democratic nomination for president, including a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll that showed her crushing Biden 73-12 percent.\u201cHe\u2019s in a predicament. It\u2019s so big, it\u2019s almost literary,\u201d said a White House insider.\u00a0\u201cNever in his entire life has [Biden] been better positioned to get the thing he most wants: the presidency.
