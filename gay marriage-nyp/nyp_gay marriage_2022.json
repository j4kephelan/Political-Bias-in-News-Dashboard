    "2022 - 12223": "On November 13, 1990, TV was changed forever with the premiere of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Real-Sex-Season-1/dp/B01MRS7ULK?tag=nypost-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://nypost.com/2021/11/14/hbo-doc-legend-sheila-nevins-network-boys-kicked-me-out-the-door/&amp;asc_source=web\">Real Sex</a>\u201d on HBO. The docuseries was raw and explicit, covering everything from masturbation classes to bisexual strip clubs.And Sheila Nevins, the producer and VP of Original Programming who brought the show to HBO, was thrilled to see just how much she could get away with.\u00a0\u201cWe could now show penises,\u201d she said to author James Andrew Miller, for his new oral history, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Tinderbox-HBOs-Ruthless-Pursuit-Frontiers/dp/1250624010?tag=nypost-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://nypost.com/2021/11/14/hbo-doc-legend-sheila-nevins-network-boys-kicked-me-out-the-door/&amp;asc_source=web\">Tinderbox: HBO\u2019s Ruthless Pursuit of New Frontiers Hardcover</a>\u201d (Henry Holt), out Nov. 23. \u201cBut we couldn\u2019t show it upright. No erect ones.\u201dIt\u2019s difficult to remember today, when sexually explicit content has become so ubiquitous \u2014 thanks to the Internet \u2014 but 30 years ago, shows like \u201cReal Sex\u201d were dangerous and groundbreaking. \u201c\u2018Real Sex\u2019 was the birth of the R-rated documentary,\u201d says Nevins. \u201cIt was the highest-rated show on HBO bar none.\u201dLong before \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d \u201cThe Wire\u201d and \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d Nevins helped establish HBO as the place to find shows you couldn\u2019t see on network TV. She was often ahead of her time, producing shows like 1985\u2019s \u201cWhat Sex Am I?\u201d \u2014 which chronicled the personal and professional struggles of transgender people \u201cat a time when even support for gay marriage was still a minority view,\u201d writes Miller \u2014 and 1987\u2019s \u201cAIDS: Everything You and Your Family Need to Know \u2026 But Were Afraid to Ask.\u201d\u201cEverybody thought I did the sex shows so I could make serious docs, like Peter to pay Paul,\u201d continues Nevins. \u201cBut that wasn\u2019t true at all. I liked them as much as I liked the serious docs. The people in them lived a life I couldn\u2019t live.\u201dNevins, who\u2019s now 82, first joined HBO\u2019s documentary division in 1979, serving as president since 2004, and during her reign won 26 Oscars, 32 Primetime Emmy Awards, 35 News and Documentary Emmys and 42 Peabody Awards. She won so many awards that HBO created a Nevins trophy room and nicknamed it \u201cthe Holy Shrine of Sheila.\u201dSpike Lee, who collaborated with her on \u201cWhen the Levees Broke,\u201d a 2006 documentary about the devastation in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina, says Nevins could be aggressively opinionated.\u00a0\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t just let you go and make what you wanted to make and not say anything,\u201d Lee says. \u201cMore times than not, what she suggested was better than my original thought.\u201dBut all the accolades weren\u2019t enough. In 2017, the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/style/sheila-nevins-leaving-hbo-documentary-films.html\">reported</a> that Nevins, the \u201cprofane, glamorous and gloriously inappropriate\u201d president of HBO Documentary Films, had decided to step down.\u00a0She told the Times that \u201cI have deprived my life of a life. All I did was work. I was, like, born at HBO and I don\u2019t have to die there.\u201dBut five years later, Nevins tells Miller that this was a complete lie.Nevins was, in fact, pushed out of HBO after 38 years, and as she filled a garbage bag with her office belongings, she felt more confused than content about how her career was ending.\u201cWhy was I beaten up and kicked out the door?\u201d she asked. \u201cWas I too old? Was I costing them too much money?\u201dNevins grew up in the \u201950s and \u201960s on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, the child of a Russian immigrant bookie and a mother suffering from Raynaud\u2019s disease, which resulted in the amputation of her left arm below the elbow. Watching the way people responded to her mother, sometimes with pity but often with revulsion, inspired Nevins to \u201cchampion stories about those less fortunate \u2026 anonymous victims of unfairness, deprivation and poverty,\u201d writes Miller.During the \u201970s, she bounced between TV producing jobs until 1985 when she was made HBO\u2019s Vice President of Documentary Programming. She brought to the network a clear vision of how HBO could stand apart.\u201cWhy should you pay for television when you can get it for free?\u201d Nevins asks. \u201cWe\u2019re going to give you hot stuff at night. We\u2019re going to tell you things you don\u2019t know about, plus things you\u2019re curious about. And we\u2019re not going to rub your nose in liberal-only thinking.\u201dHer first big success was \u201cReal Sex,\u201d followed in \u201995 by \u201cTaxicab Confessions,\u201d where New Yorkers were secretly recorded in cabs sharing \u201cpoignant tales of loss and longing to ribald stories of semi-salacious sex,\u201d Miller writes. \u201cThere were even scenes of actual fornication in the backs of cabs.\u201dAs she raked in critical acclaim, HBO gave her complete creative autonomy. \u201cThey left me alone,\u201d says Nevins, who was promoted to president of Documentary and Family Programming in 2004. \u201cThey gave me money. I worked within that amount of money. And they never told me I did a good job.\u201d\u201cTaxicab Confessions,\u201d which ran till 2006, could be vulgar and titillating, but according to co-creator Harry Gantz, it also \u201chelped you see the humanity in people who were different from you.\u201dGantz remembers visiting a sex workers convention in Las Vegas and receiving a standing ovation. Prostitutes were frequently featured on \u201cTaxicab Confessions,\u201d sharing details of their lives that weren\u2019t usually portrayed in the media.\u201cWe gave them a voice to talk about their experiences rather than deciding who they were ahead of time,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople began to realize that this was a transformative show, because it took the shame out of confessing, of sharing the parts of yourself that you were ashamed about.\u201dBy the 2010s, Nevins had been at HBO longer than almost any other exec, but she didn\u2019t worry about appearing old and out of touch in a youth-centric industry. \u201cI knew they couldn\u2019t afford to lose me,\u201d she says. \u201cI was wily. I think I learned it from the hookers.\u201dJeff Bewkes, one-time CEO of Time Warner, HBO\u2019s parent company, calls the network a boys\u2019 club, but adds, \u201cThere were a lot of strong women who took no shit and gave as good as they got,\u201d pointing to Nevins as one of them.Even Chris Albrecht, a former Chairman and CEO of HBO between 2002 and 2007, often credited with spawning a Golden Age of television with shows like \u201cThe Wire\u201d and \u201cSix Feet Under,\u201d knew better than to interfere with Nevins. \u201cWhat am I gonna tell Sheila about a documentary?\u201d he says. \u201cIt didn\u2019t do me any good to have a turf war with Sheila.\u201dSome learned this the hard way. In 2005, when venerated ABC anchor Ted Koppel was in negotiations with HBO to create original programming, Nevins \u201cwent on a scorched-earth campaign, the likes of which you\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d says Jon Alpert, a filmmaker and longtime Nevins collaborator.\u00a0Fearing that she would be replaced, Nevins spent weeks \u201cscreaming and swearing on the phone\u201d to HBO execs, according to Alpert. Koppel finally gave up on the network. \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t worth the stress that we were going to cause,\u201d Koppel told Miller, adding that \u201cSheila is a lovely woman, and I enjoy her a great deal.\u201dNevins\u2019 memory of that moment isn\u2019t as rosy. Months after Koppel\u2019s HBO deal fell apart, she said she ran into the news anchor at the Canyon Ranch spa, and he called her \u201ca snake.\u201dNevins didn\u2019t respond, but says she thought to herself, \u201cF\u2013k you, mister, I got you out.\u201d\u00a0She also had a less than amicable relationship with Richard Plepler, the two-decades younger HBO exec who became CEO in 2013. \u201cRichard knew how to work her,\u201d says Mike Lombardo, who served as HBO\u2019s co-president with Plepler in 2007. \u201cHe would do this for years, he would be like, \u2018How old is she again?\u2019 He was out to f\u2013k her from day one. I\u2019d watch him with her. He was a master at it.\u201dThe animosity between Plepler and Nevins wasn\u2019t just down to their age difference. \u201cNevins and Plepler had different tastes in documentaries,\u201d Miller writes. \u201cPlepler veered toward projects built around celebrities and big names, whereas Nevins maintained an interest in grittier, more journalistic stories.\u201dAlthough Nevins enjoyed any opportunity to rub shoulders with A-listers like Mike Nichols and Steven Spielberg, \u201cshe wasn\u2019t all that interested in telling their stories,\u201d Miller writes. \u201cAs time went on, Nevins had long felt she had to push harder and harder to keep HBO\u2019s documentaries rooted in real-world subjects.\u201dNevins was slowly being pushed out, and not just at the office. \u201cPlepler hosted renowned, hoity-toity salons and dinner parties, but Nevins was not invited to them,\u201d Miller writes. \u201cShe never cracked into his inner circle.\u201d\u201cI was aware of conflicts that were coming down the pike,\u201d says Alex Gibney, an Emmy-winning documentarian who collaborated with Nevins on the 2015 HBO hit \u201cGoing Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief.\u201d \u201cSome of my projects were green-lit, not by going to Sheila but by having them green-lit out of LA through Mike Lombardo. You could tell Mike and Richard were making decisions over her head and that she was losing the power to run her department.\u201dBoth sides tell very different stories. Lombardo recounts trying to get an Elvis Presley doc made at HBO but Nevins \u201cdidn\u2019t want to do docs about people,\u201d he says. When Nevins found out he went over her head to get the documentary made, she called him in a rage. \u201cShe raised her voice on the phone to me,\u201d Lombardo remembers. \u201cThings got really heated.\u201dNevins recalls conversations with Lombardo in which <em>he</em> called <em>her</em> screaming. \u201cHe was tyrannical,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was disturbed. I started crying.\u201d Lombardo didn\u2019t just dislike her, she says, he \u201chated me. He wished I was dead. Destroyed me. Destroyed my soul.\u201dOn December 16, 2017, Nevins announced she was leaving. To the world, it was presented as her decision. Plepler gave her a hero\u2019s send-off. \u201cThe word \u2018legend\u2019 is often thrown around loosely in our business,\u201d he wrote in a statement. \u201cBut in Sheila\u2019s case, it actually applies.\u201d She was given an undisclosed severance and a glowing profile in the Times, but after 2018, most of the shows she helped create for HBO, from \u201cReal Sex\u201d to \u201cTaxicab Confessions,\u201d were quietly removed from the network\u2019s streaming services.\u00a0Many of the filmmakers who worked with Nevins knew the real reasons she left. \u201cShe was a 79-year-old woman,\u201d says Alexandra Pelosi, a director who sold several films to Nevins (and is also the daughter of Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi). \u201cCorporate America doesn\u2019t respect 79-year-old women.\u201dIt also didn\u2019t help that Nevins is a \u201cfoulmouthed truth-teller,\u201d says Pelosi. \u201cNobody likes truth-tellers at their parties. They say inappropriate things out loud.\u201dNevins acknowledges her reputation. \u201cI never would have worked for me,\u201d she admits. \u201cNever. Not in a million years. What a bitch! But I felt that I had earned the right to be difficult because I was being difficult for the product.\u201dHer departure all came down to a fundamental difference between how Nevins and Plepler saw the world.\u201cRichard hangs around in a society where the food miraculously appears on your table, but you never meet the people in the fields who harvest it,\u201d says filmmaker Rory Kennedy, directed the 2003 HBO docuseries \u201cPandemic: Facing AIDS\u201d under Nevins\u2019 watch. \u201cSheila comes from the Lower East Side, went to Communist sleepaway camp.\u201d (Pleper later left the network in 2019, stating that he had been with HBO \u201cnearly 28 years.\u201d He is now running his own production company, and declined to comment on Nevins or her departure from HBO for Miller\u2019s book.)Nevins, meanwhile, accepted an offer by MTV to start up their Documentary Films division two years after leaving HBO. \u201cI was hired by MTV because I was a brand,\u201d she says. \u201cThey didn\u2019t care how the f\u2013k old I was. I just gave clout to their reality stuff.\u201dThe ultimate revenge? In September, just two years after Nevins moved to MTV, the  network scored its first-ever Emmy Award for a documentary with \u201c<a href=\"https://deadline.com/tag/76-days/\">76 Days</a>,\u201d chronicling the Wuhan lockdown in 2020. And who did she beat to win it? HBO.",
    "2022 - 1309": "GENEVA \u2014 Switzerland\u2019s executive body announced Wednesday that same-sex couples can get married starting on July 1 next year, making good on the resounding support Swiss voters expressed in a referendum.The Federal Council officially said that starting Jan. 1, Switzerland would recognize the marriages of same-sex couples who wed in other countries instead of continuing to treat the unions as simple civil partnerships.In setting a date for the \u201cMarriage for All\u201d law approved by voters in September to take effect, the council said that civil partnerships would no longer be possible in Switzerland as of July 1. Couples already in civil partnerships, which the country authorized in 2007, will be allowed to maintain them without having to get married.Switzerland is one of the few remaining countries in Western Europe where gay and lesbian couples do not already have the right to wed.The referendum approved by an overwhelming majority on Sept. 26 will put same-sex partners in the rich Alpine nation on equal legal footing with heterosexual couples, including by allowing them to adopt children together and to sponsor a spouse for citizenship.Supporters of the referendum had acknowledged it would be months before same-sex marriages could begin, mostly for administrative and legislative procedures.",
    "2022 - 4646": "Democrats can no longer count on Hispanic voters to <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/12/06/40-percent-of-hispanic-voters-are-offended-by-latinx-poll-finds/\">back them en bloc at the polls</a>, according to a new survey released exactly 11 months before next year\u2019s midterm elections. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/hispanic-voters-now-evenly-split-between-parties-wsj-poll-finds-11638972769\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Wall Street Journal</a> poll finds that 37 percent of Hispanic voters would support a Democrat for Congress while 37 percent would support a Republican if an election were held today, with 22 percent undecided. By contrast, Democratic House candidates received more than 60 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2020. Hispanic voters were also divided when asked about the <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/10/20/trump-biden-tied-in-potential-2024-election-faceoff-poll/\">possibility of a rematch</a> between President Biden and former President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election. According to the survey, 44 percent of Hispanic voters said they would back Biden, while 43 percent said they would pull the lever for Trump. In 2020, exit polls indicated that Biden won Hispanic voters by about a two-to-one margin.There was more bad news for Democrats in the job approval numbers for Biden among Hispanic voters, with 54 percent disapproving of his performance and 42 percent approving \u2014 a number only slightly higher than the president\u2019s <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/11/27/biden-poll-numbers-creep-upwards/\">dismal national approval rating</a>.Hispanic voters make up roughly 12.5 percent of eligible voters in the US and the survey indicates that many of them \u2014 particularly men \u2014 are moving toward the GOP.According to the survey, 61 percent of Hispanic men disapprove of Biden\u2019s job performance, 56 percent would vote for Trump if he ran against Biden in 2024, and 45 percent would vote for a Republican congressional candidate in 2022. The poll also found that Hispanic men supported Republican economic policies over Democratic policies by a 17 percentage-point margin, while Hispanic women supported Democratic economic policies by 10 percentage points. Similarly, a majority of Hispanic men wish to reimplement policies put in place by Trump, while a majority of Hispanic women say they would rather keep Biden\u2019s policies in place.Hispanic voters overall hold negative opinions about the economy, with just 25 percent saying it is headed in the right direction while 63 percent say it is headed in the wrong direction.\u00a0When it came to Congress, Hispanic voters were more likely to support Republicans on issues like the economy and the border, but backed Democrats to handle the COVID-19 pandemic, infrastructure and lowering health care costs.\u00a0Shortly after last year\u2019s election, former President Barack Obama <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/11/25/barack-obama-attacks-hispanic-voters-for-supporting-trump/\">theorized that Hispanics who voted for Trump</a> looked past his inflammatory rhetoric and immigration policies because they were aligned on social issues.\u201cThose of us who live in DC or New York or LA,\u201d Obama said during an interview with \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jezBwRpwszM\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Breakfast Club</a>\u201d radio program, sometimes lack \u201ca good enough sense of how big this country is and how a lot of folks do not accept at all\u201d policies that people living in larger metropolitan areas take for granted.\u201cPeople were surprised about a lot of Hispanic folks who voted for Trump, but there\u2019s a lot of evangelical Hispanics who, you know, the fact that Trump says racist things about Mexicans, or puts detainees, undocumented workers in cages \u2014 they think that\u2019s less important than the fact that he supports their views on gay marriage or abortion,\u201d he said.Republicans are hoping to regain control of the House and Senate next year after two years of Democratic control of Congress and the White House. GOP operatives would have been encouraged by the result of last month\u2019s Virginia gubernatorial election, in which victorious Republican <a href=\"https://interactives.ap.org/votecast-2021-va/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Glenn Youngkin defeated Democrat Terry McAuliffe by 12 percentage points</a> among Hispanic voters. The poll surveyed 165 Hispanic voters as part of a sample of 1,500 registered voters between Nov. 16 and 22. The margin of error of the Hispanic sample of the survey was plus or minus 7.6 percentage points, while the full poll\u2019s margin of error was plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.",

    "2022 - 6578": "A Lebanese father tells his teenage daughter she is free to choose whether to have sex with her boyfriend despite his reservations.An Egyptian wife discreetly slips off her black, lacy underwear from under her clothes before heading out for dinner, and it\u2019s not her husband she\u2019s trying to tantalize.And in a dramatic moment, a man reveals that he is gay, a secret he has kept from his longtime friends who are shocked \u2014 but seem mostly accepting.The scenes in the first Arabic Netflix movie have sparked a public drama as intense as the one that plays out onscreen. On social media and TV talk shows and among friends in Egypt and other Middle East countries, a torrent of critics have denounced the film as a threat to family and religious values, encouraging homosexuality and unfit for Arab societies.Others have rallied to the film\u2019s defense, saying detractors are in denial about what happens behind closed doors in real life. Those who don\u2019t like the movie, they argue, are free to not subscribe to Netflix or simply skip the film.Titled \u201cAshab Wala A\u2019azz,\u201d which means \u201cNo Dearer Friends,\u201d the movie is an Arabic version of the Italian hit \u201cPerfect Strangers,\u201d which has inspired many other international remakes. It tells the story of seven friends at a dinner party gone wrong after the hostess suggests that, as a game, they agree to share any calls, text and voice messages. As smart phones buzz, secrets are revealed, infidelities are exposed and relationships are tested.The controversy has re-ignited debates in the region over artistic freedom versus social and religious sensitivities; censorship; what constitutes a taboo in different societies and portrayal of gay characters.One irony is that Netflix in the Middle East shows many non-Arabic movies and series that feature gay characters in a positive light, premarital and extramarital sex and even nudity \u2014 which is typically banned in cinemas in the region \u2014 with little outcry.But to see those themes broached in an Arabic-language movie with Arab actors went too far for some. (The movie has no nudity; it\u2019s largely an hour and half of people talking around a dinner table.)\u201cI think if it\u2019s a normal foreign movie, I will be ok. But because it\u2019s an Arabic movie, I didn\u2019t accept it,\u201d said 37-year-old Elham, an Egyptian who asked for her last name to be withheld due to the sensitivity of the topic. \u201cWe don\u2019t accept the idea of homosexuality or intimate relations before marriage in our society, so what happened was a cultural shock.\u201dHomosexuality is a particularly strong taboo in Egypt: A 2013 survey by the Pew Research Center found that 95% in the country say it should be rejected by society; in Lebanon, that number stood at 80% at the time.The movie\u2019s cast are mostly prominent Lebanese stars and its events are set in Lebanon. There, it has garnered many positive reviews. Fans said it discussed relatable topics away from stereotypes that are usually attached to gay characters or cheating spouses on screen.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like the Arab world\u2019s hatred of the truth,\u201d Rabih Farran, a Lebanese journalist, said in a tweet, referring to the backlash.It\u2019s not the first time that an Arabic-language movie has featured gay characters.Most famously, the 2006 movie \u201cThe Yacoubian Building\u201d with a cast of A-list Egyptian actors caused a stir for, among other things, including a gay main character. But the character was ultimately killed by his lover in what many saw as punishment.In contrast, the gay character in \u201cAshab Wala A\u2019azz\u201d is not depicted negatively. Another character encourages him to expose his former employers who let him go for his sexual identity.Fatima Kamal, a 43-year-old Egyptian, said she didn\u2019t find it to be promoting same-sex relationships. She argued that some Egyptian movies in the past were more daring.\u201cThe movie touched on issues that the society refuses to confront but they do happen,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all have a dark side and hidden stories.\u201dKamal, who has a 12-year-old son, also dismissed the idea the film would corrupt Arab youth.\u201cTechnology has changed society. Restricting movies is not the answer,\u201d she said. \u201cThe solution is to watch based on age ratings and to talk to the young and make them understand that not everything we see on the screen is OK.\u201dTalking on a popular TV show, Egyptian lawmaker Mostafa Bakry contended Egyptian and Arab family values are being targeted.\u201cThis is neither art nor creativity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must ban Netflix from being in Egypt\u201d even if temporarily.Magda Maurice, an art critic debating Bakry on the show, disagreed. \u201cThis movie exposes what mobile phones do to people and to their normal lives,\u201d she said.\u201cYou cannot ban anything now but you can confront it with good art,\u201d she added. \u201cBanning has become a thing of the past.\u201dIn Egypt, much of the furor focused on the sole Egyptian woman in the cast, Mona Zaki, one of the country\u2019s biggest stars. Her character is the one seen slipping off her underwear, a gesture that many critics decried as scandalous.In social media, some attacked her for participating in the film. The online abuse extended to actors and actresses who supported her or praised her performance. Some criticized her real-life husband, an Egyptian movie star in his own right, for \u201callowing\u201d her to play the role.The Egyptian actors syndicate came out in support of Zaki, saying it will not abide verbal abuse or intimidation against actors over their work. It said that freedom of creativity \u201cis protected and defended by the syndicate,\u201d while adding that it is committed to the values of Egyptian society.The Associated Press reached out to Netflix for a comment on the controversy but didn\u2019t receive one.Egypt has long celebrated its cinema industry, which earned it the nickname \u201cHollywood of the East,\u201d lured actors from other Arabic-speaking countries and brought Egyptian movies and dialect into Arab homes the world over.Film critic Khaled Mahmoud said Egypt \u201cused to produce powerful and daring movies in the 1960s and 1970s.\u201d But much of that adventurousness has been lost with the trend of so-called \u201cclean cinema,\u201d emphasizing themes deemed family appropriate with no physical intimacy or immodest attire, he added.\u201cSociety has changed, and the viewership culture has become flawed.\u201dStory lines about affairs or sexual relations are not uncommon in Arabic films. But female stars are commonly grilled in interviews over whether they would agree to wear swimsuits or kiss co-stars on camera.\u201cOur job is to let art be art,\u201d Mahmoud said. \u201cWe cannot critique art through a moral lens.\u201d",
    "2022 - 5684": "Whitney Houston was the perfect face for the MTV-dominated 1980s, \u201ca glamorous showgirl shaped by a Svengali\u201d \u2013 the powerful Arista Records producer Clive Davis.But she also possessed a deep, dark secret: she was a closeted lesbian, writes author Gerrick Kennedy in his new book, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Didnt-We-Almost-Have-All/dp/1419749692?tag=nypost-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://nypost.com/2022/02/05/inside-whitney-houstons-torment-for-being-a-closeted-lesbian/&amp;asc_source=web\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Didn\u2019t We Almost Have It All: In Defense of Whitney Houston</a>\u201d (Abrams Press), out Tuesday.Feeling pressure to conform to her strict religious upbringing and the norms of the time, Whitney hid her sexuality from the public till her tragic death, which happened 10 years ago this week. \u201cBecause her music didn\u2019t fit squarely in the boxes expected of a Black girl making music in the \u201980s, she was seen as\u00a0<em>not Black enough.\u00a0</em>She was ridiculed. Brandished \u2018Whitey\u2019 \u2014 and endured endless speculation on her sexuality,\u201d the author notes.Raised in Newark, NJ, Whitney was under the thumb of her mother, Cissy, a devout church member of Newark\u2019s New Hope Baptist Church and a member of the gospel singing clan, the Drinkard Sisters.The Drinkards played the \u201cChitlin\u2019 Circuit,\u201d performing at black venues throughout the South. Cissy was a star in her own right \u2014 singing backup to the King himself, Elvis Presley, and Aretha Franklin, the Queen of Soul.Even as a little girl, Whitney felt different. She was a tomboy and bristled at wearing the frilly clothes and hair ribbons chosen by her mother. She preferred jeans, t-shirts and running track with her two older brothers, Gary and Michael.The three children floated between the homes of relatives when the parents were working and Cissy was on the road. Soon, Whitney was swept up in Cissy\u2019s all-consuming desire to push her into the singing business.\u201cCissy knew Whitney was destined for greatness and she could get her there. She rode her hard at church and\u00a0encouraged her little girl to sing along to the records she and Aretha made. She didn\u2019t take no shit,\u201d Kennedy writes.Cissy\u2019s solo career didn\u2019t take off and although she was in demand as a backup singer, the recording industry was fickle. Whitney\u2019s cousin,\u00a0chart topping R&amp;B singer Dionne Warwick, also helped encourage the young girl\u2019s vocal talent, viewed as the family\u2019s ticket out of poverty. At the same time, Whitney was exploring her identity. In the summer of 1980, when she was 17, she introduced herself to a stunning, slender 19-year-old, Robyn Crawford, when they were both working as youth counselors at the East Orange Community Center in NJ.\u201cIt was a bond that formed almost immediately, and they were inseparable that summer. If you saw one, you saw the other,\u201d writes Kennedy.Crawford, Whitney\u2019s first close friend, confidante and companion outside of her brothers, had Whitney\u2019s back and was \u201cunyieldingly loyal.\u201dWith Crawford, Houston could be the tomboy who preferred smoking Newports, getting high and cursing.In the Houston living room that same year, Whitney and Robyn came together. \u201cTheir lips met, bound by all that had been unspoken between the two. That first kiss was long, warm like honey,\u201d Kennedy writes.\u201cIt was free and honest \u2013 loving and tender,\u201d Robyn wrote in her 2019 memoir,\u00a0\u201c<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Song-You-Life-Whitney-Houston/dp/1524742848?tag=nypost-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://nypost.com/2022/02/05/inside-whitney-houstons-torment-for-being-a-closeted-lesbian/&amp;asc_source=web\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">A Song For You: My Life With Whitney Houston</a>,\u201d\u00a0after decades of silence. \u201cWe both wanted to touch and explore each other, and we did until we fell asleep in each other\u2019s arms.\u201dTogether\u00a0that summer,\u00a0they sunbathed\u00a0at the Jersey Shore,\u00a0went\u00a0to gay clubs, and made out in a rental car before being told to move along by a cop.Robyn drove Whitney to club shows, Whitney attended Robyn\u2019s college basketball games. They\u00a0also\u00a0trekked to Harlem to buy a dime bag of weed and score cocaine,\u00a0Robyn wrote.\u201cThey were partners in a traditional sense but never had a real conversation about labels \u2014 lesbian, gay, bisexual, girlfriend,\u201d Kennedy writes.\u201cWe were friends. We were lovers. We were everything to each other. We weren\u2019t falling in love. We just were. We were one: that\u2019s how it felt,\u201d Robyn wrote in her book.In bed, they plotted songs Whitney would sing \u2014 and their future.In that same summer of 1980, they got an apartment together<strong>\u00a0</strong>and Whitney promised to take Robyn wherever she was headed, Kennedy writes.But when whispers of the girl-girl relationship reached Cissy\u2019s ear, she had a fit and tried to keep the two from even walking next to each other in public.\u2018We were friends. We were lovers. We were everything to each other.\u2019The church and the record industry were both so homophobic, Whitney knew the affair had to end when Clive Davis gave her a record deal. She broke the news to Robyn.\u201cYou know how I feel about you and we will always have that,\u201d Whitney told her sweetheart,\u00a0Kennedy writes.With her 1985 debut single, Whitney Houston was \u201con fire out the gate.\u201d Her first album soared to No. 1 in 1987 and by the early 1990s, she had 10 No. 1 singles.The love affair with Robyn was over the summer it began but Whitney made her an executive assistant \u2014 \u201ca role that expanded over time,\u201d Kennedy writes.Of her time with Whitney, she said, \u201cYes, in the end it was tragic, but the dream and the rise were beautiful. I owe it to my friend to share her story, my story. Our story. And I hope that in doing so, I can set us free.\u201d",
