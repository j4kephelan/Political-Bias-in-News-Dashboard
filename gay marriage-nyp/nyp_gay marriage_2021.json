    "2021 - 1944": "Consensual incest advocates are rooting for an anonymous New York parent <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/04/10/new-york-parent-seeks-ok-to-marry-their-own-adult-child/\">who wants to marry their own adult child</a>. Australian Richard Morris, who is pushing to change incest laws in about 60 countries, said he supports the legal push in Manhattan Federal Court and that such behavior between consenting adults \u201cshould not be criminalized.\u201dHe and other advocates have launched about 130 petitions, mostly on change.org, seeking to change incest laws around the world. Most have received little support.\u201cWe haven\u2019t moved any mountains yet,\u201d he told The Post. Morris was inspired to fight for those in consenting incestual relationships, he said, after learning about a Scottish case in which a long-separated father and daughter were reunited, started an affair and were then criminally convicted. Fighting for true \u201cmarriage equality\u201d is \u201cthe right thing to do, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Morris said. \u201cIt seems to be\u00a0as unjust as the law that used to imprison gay\u00a0people, and the law that used to stop people of different races marrying,\u201d he added. Keith Pullman, who runs the <a href=\"http://marriage-equality.blogspot.com/p/a-message-to-youth.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blog Full Marriage Equality</a>, also cheered on the New York lawsuit.\u201cIt is absurd to say that an adult can\u2019t consent to marry their parent. That same adult can be sent to war, take on six or seven\u00a0figures of debt, operate heavy machinery, be sentenced to death by a federal court, and consent to sex with five strangers (and marriage with one of them)\u00a0but can\u2019t consent to marry\u00a0someone they love?\u201d he told The Post. \u201cIn some of these cases, the genetic parent didn\u2019t raise them and they met for the first time two years ago. Allegations of \u2018grooming\u2019 are laughable attempts to deny someone their rights even though it will have no impact on the person objecting.\u201d",

    "2021 - 5153": "Jeff Bezos pushed an unfounded theory that Saudi Arabia was <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/01/21/saudi-prince-may-be-responsible-for-stealing-jeff-bezos-nudes/\">behind the revelation of his affair</a> with Lauren Sanchez \u2014 and relished how it shifted the focus away \u201cfrom the more unsavory and complicated truth,\u201d a new biography claims.In \u201c<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Unbound-Invention-Global-Empire/dp/1982132612/?tag=nypost-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://nypost.com/2021/05/12/jeff-bezos-bio-makes-bombshell-claims-about-alleged-saudi-role-purported-penis-pic/&amp;asc_source=web\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Unbound: Jeff Bezos and the Invention of a Global Empire</a>,\u201d author Brad Stone says that there\u2019s no \u201cconclusive evidence\u201d to back up suggestions by the world\u2019s richest man and his security consultant that Saudi Arabia tipped off the National Enquirer.The nearly 500-page book also reveals that the infamous <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2019/01/10/jeff-bezos-texts-to-lauren-sanchez-reportedly-include-nude-pics/\">purported selfie of Bezos\u2019 penis</a> wasn\u2019t real \u2014 and was actually grabbed by Sanchez\u2019s brother, Michael Sanchez, from a website for gay escorts.Michael Sanchez \u201clater told FBI investigators for the Southern District of New York that he never actually had an explicit photograph of Bezos in his possession,\u201d Stone writes.In a chapter detailing how Bezos <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2019/04/04/jeff-bezos-and-his-wife-mackenzie-finalize-their-divorce/\">blew up his 25-year marriage</a> to since-remarried MacKenzie Scott, Stone notes how the billionaire \u201cartfully suggested\u201d in a February 2019 essay <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">posted on Medium.com</a> that the Saudis may have been behind the Enquirer\u2019s exclusive.Stone says Bezos \u201ctook the already muddled question of how the paper obtained his private text messages and photographs and confused it further\u201d by writing online that the story\u2019s genesis was \u201cstill to be better understood\u201d and that \u201cthe Saudi angle seems to hit a particular nerve\u201d with the Enquirer\u2019s parent company, American Media Inc.Stone also highlights an article that private security expert Gavin de Becker \u2014 a longtime Bezos pal \u2014 penned the following month <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeff-bezos-investigation-finds-the-saudis-obtained-his-private-information\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">for the Daily Beast</a>.\u201cOur investigators and several experts concluded with high confidence that the Saudis had access to Bezos\u2019 phone and gained private information. As of today, it is unclear to what degree, if any, AMI was aware of the details,\u201d de Becker wrote.But Stone claims the Enquirer actually got nine \u201cpersonal\u201d photos of Bezos from Michael Sanchez under terms of a contract worth around $200,000 \u2014 the most it ever paid for a scoop.And Michael Sanchez allegedly got the photos from his sister, who \u201cfrequently forwarded\u201d Bezos\u2019 text messages to him, according to the book.\u201cThe sibling relationship was, to put it mildly, unusual,\u201d Stone writes.Stone says the possibility that the Saudis tipped off the Enquirer or added to what it got from Michael Sanchez was \u201conly a fog of overlapping events, weak ties between disparate figures and more strange coincidences.\u201d\u201cFor Bezos and his advisors, though, who were still trying to positively spin the embarrassing events surrounding his divorce, such a cloud of uncertainty was at the very least distracting from the more unsavory and complicated truth.\u201dMeanwhile, Stone writes, the infamous penis photo wasn\u2019t among the images that Michael Sanchez handed over to the Enquirer \u2014 although he did display it during a Nov. 21, 2018, meeting with reporter Andrea Simpson after claiming he had an explicit selfie that Bezos sent to Sanchez\u2019s sister.With then-AMI chief content officer Dylan Howard and editor James Robertson \u201cwatching via FaceTime from New York and recording the transaction, Sanchez didn\u2019t show them a picture of Bezos at all but an anonymous photograph of male genitalia that he had captured from the gay escort website Rent.men,\u201d according to the book.An Amazon spokesman declined to comment and de Becker didn\u2019t return an email to his eponymous Glendale, Calif.-based security firm.Michael Sanchez\u2019s lawyer, Jonathan Jenkins, said, \u201cAs FBI and Amazon investigators confirmed, Michael Sanchez never possessed any penis photos Mr. Bezos sent to Ms. Sanchez.\u201dAn email to A360 Media \u2014 which subsumed AMI in a deal last year \u2014 wasn\u2019t returned.A spokesperson for Howard said, \u201cThe Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York has advised all parties that it has completed its investigation of allegations made by Jeff Bezos in February 2019, and has declined to prosecute the matter.\u201d\u201cWe are glad that the Government decided that Mr. Bezos\u2019s allegations of blackmail and extortion against personnel at The National Enquirer did not merit prosecution, as we had believed it would all along,\u201d the spokesperson added.<em>Additional reporting by Rebecca Rosenberg</em>",
    "2021 - 12691": "HAMPTON, S.C. \u2014 Maggie Kennedy Branstetter was a pretty blond sorority girl at the University of South Carolina in the late \u201980s when she met and soon married Alexander Murdaugh, a scion of the <a href=\"https://www.thestate.com/news/local/crime/article227456544.html\">state\u2019s most powerful legal dynasty</a>.The couple would become the leading lights in otherwise mostly poor Hampton County, holding forth from one of their three estates. Maggie Murdaugh, who favored furs when the weather was cold enough, preferred to stay at the couple\u2019s hunting lodge just outside the town of Hampton where their two sons, Buster and Paul, liked to shoot wild animals. In the summer the Murdaughs spent time on their 17-foot powerboat.But marriage to her college sweetheart sealed Maggie\u2019s doom. Two weeks ago, the bubbly 52-year-old \u201cMrs. Maggie,\u201d as some friends and her servants called her, was <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/06/11/mother-and-son-of-prominent-south-carolina-family-found-shot-dead/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">shot to death</a> near the dog kennels on the <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/06/17/top-sc-prosecutor-found-wife-and-son-shot-dead-authorities/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">grounds of the family\u2019s hunting lodge</a>. Also gunned down was her and Alex\u2019s troubled 22-year-old son, Paul.Alex found the bodies at the lodge, called \u201cMoselle,\u201d around 10 p.m. on June 7. The victims were <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/06/15/murdered-s-c-mom-and-son-both-shot-multiple-times-coroner/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">shot multiple times</a>, the coroner said, reportedly with a semi-automatic assault rifle and a shotgun. He ruled the deaths a double homicide.But some locals in this swampy, rural Lowcountry town, where the Murdaughs have ruled like kings for more than a century, whisper that the murders might be karmic retribution \u2014 for a variety of secrets, sins and tragic deaths tied to the family. \u201cMrs. Maggie don\u2019t deserve this,\u201d said Gabby Thomas, 62, whose hunting club is adjacent to the Murdaughs\u2019 lodge. \u201cShe\u2019d give you the shirt off her back, that one. Wonderful woman. Them others? I don\u2019t know. But she sure spoiled Paul. I heard him talk back to her once so bad in the beauty parlor once that I made him apologize.\u201dAt the time of his death, Paul was <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/06/16/murdered-paul-murdaugh-reportedly-had-more-brushes-with-law/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">facing trial on felony boat-driving charges</a> in connection with a crash that killed a 19-year-old woman in 2019.The mystery of the Murdaugh murders has exploded into a Netflix-ready Southern Gothic thriller that\u2019s part Grisham, part Faulkner, with more than a dash of Capote\u2019s \u201cIn Cold Blood.\u201dThe untouchable family ran the prosecutor\u2019s offices in the five counties that make up the Lowcountry while also, incredibly, operating a powerhouse litigation firm, <a href=\"https://www.pmped.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Peters, Murdaugh, Parker, Eltzroth &amp; Detrick</a>, with tentacles in the highest echelons of the red state \u2014 despite being Democrats. The story also features an apparently deranged heir in Paul Murdaugh, who allegedly had a dangerous alter ego \u2014\u00a0called \u201cTimmy\u201d by friends \u2014 when he drank.The Murdaughs aren\u2019t happy about their sudden notoriety. The family barred a Post reporter from entering the Murdaugh law firm in Hampton \u2014 only 65 miles but a world away from chic Charleston \u2014 last week before briefly sending out a lawyer who refused to say if Alex Murdaugh had official representation or comment. \u201cWhen you get so used to controlling the narrative and everyone around you for so long, you\u2019re not prepared for this kind of scrutiny from the outside,\u201d Todd Proctor, a former South Carolina Highway Patrol detective who investigated a death he believes may be connected to the Murdaugh family, told The Post. (No member of the family was ever charged or considered a formal suspect.)\u201cThis is all new to them.\u201dCops reportedly said early on that Alex was a \u201cperson of interest\u201d in the investigation of his wife and son\u2019s deaths, but now say he was not. The family has claimed he has a rock-solid alibi: He was visiting his dying father in the hospital at the time of the killings.Though the murders happened June 7, neither police nor the Murdaugh family initially commented on them other than to say there was no risk to the public. There was no manhunt announced, no reward offered.Then two of Alex\u2019s brothers appeared on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNFhXYKj3Gw\">\u201cGood Morning America\u201d </a>this week, suddenly calling for the public\u2019s help in finding the killer. Within hours of the TV appearance, police abruptly began dredging an area of swampland not far from the lodge and set up a dedicated tip line.Local newspaper The Island Packet reported this week that investigators are looking into the possibility that Paul was the intended target. His uncles claimed on the show that the Paul had recently <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/06/17/sc-mom-son-were-sent-threats-before-murders-family-reveals/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">received death threats</a> but also said \u201cwe really don\u2019t know of any enemies\u201d \u2014\u00a0though others in town seem to disagree.\u201cPaul\u2019s daddy don\u2019t look like Boss Hogg,\u201d said an older resident of Hampton who did not want to be identified by name, \u201cbut that\u2019s who he is.\u201d Around town, where the Murdaughs are both liked and feared, there\u2019s no end to the rumors of whodunit \u2014\u00a0and a long list of <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/06/12/son-of-prominent-south-carolina-family-may-have-been-double-murder-target/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">potential enemies</a>, from former employees to people they helped prosecute or sue. Many people are afraid to talk for fear they will now be considered suspects acting out of revenge.Two of the most prominent families being gossiped about as having a possible motive are the parents of Mallory Beach, who died in the boating accident; and the mother of a young gay man who was found dead on a local road under mysterious circumstances in 2015.  Alex\u2019s great-grandfather, Randolph Murdaugh Sr., started the family law firm as a sole practitioner in 1910. Ten years later, he also became the local prosecutor. His son was elected to take his place in 1940. And Randolph Murdaugh III, Alex\u2019s father, was the solicitor until 2005 when Duffie Stone, a Murdaugh ally, was elected to the position.Many local residents are connected to the Murdaughs \u2014 personally, professionally or, often, both. Even Tommy Crosby, the spokesman for the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division or SLED, which is handling the murder investigation, grew up in Hampton and knows the family. Although Alex Murdaugh\u00a0serves part-time as a prosecutor for the 14th Judicial Circuit, he\u2019s also a personal-injury lawyer with his family\u2019s law firm. Stone, the 14th Circuit Solicitor, which is local parlance for district attorney, has not recused himself from the double-homicide investigation.\u201cYes it\u2019s a conflict of interest,\u201d attorney Mark Tinsley, himself a longtime friend of the Murdaughs, told The Post. \u201cIt\u2019s a little absurd.\u201dTinsley also represents the family of Mallory Beach, the 19-year-old woman who was killed after being thrown from the Murdaugh family speedboat in February 2019.Paul, 20 at the time, was driving and was indicted on three felony charges, including boating under the influence. According to <a href=\"https://publicindex.sccourts.org/Hampton/PublicIndex/PIImageDisplay.aspx?ctagency=25002&amp;doctype=D&amp;docid=1591801159870-142&amp;HKey=751211037171725611552659751656610987841081078167539981907685101106761141136569112971189898878811277\">depositions</a> released last summer, Paul was among a group of six underage people who bought alcohol with fake IDs before getting into the boat to go to an oyster roast on Paukie Island near Beaufort, SC.Anthony Cook \u2014\u00a0Mallory\u2019s boyfriend and Paul\u2019s childhood friend \u2014 <a href=\"https://publicindex.sccourts.org/Hampton/PublicIndex/PIImageDisplay.aspx?ctagency=25002&amp;doctype=D&amp;docid=1591801159886-106&amp;HKey=11511677121537610149558952102116566790811197097557298116486751741034784574311752117122105101888411569\">testified </a>that Paul got in a fight with his girlfriend on the way home, not long before the crash, and slapped her. Paul allegedly later plowed the boat into a bridge piling, causing Mallory to be thrown from the craft.Her body was found in the water a week later. Local media reports at the time claimed that Paul was never given a sobriety test at the hospital after the crash because his father and uncle showed up to prevent it.Cook said friends started calling Paul\u2019s <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/06/13/sc-man-murdered-with-mom-had-drunken-alter-ego-report/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">drunken alter ego</a> \u201cTimmy\u201d as far back as 2015, when Paul would have been 16. \u201cTimmy\u201d was reportedly known for stripping down to his boxer shorts.\u201cIt started one night at Mr. Alex\u2019s house in Moselle,\u201d Cook said. \u201cI don\u2019t remember who came up with the name but it\u2019s \u2026 because he turns into a completely different person. So somebody will say, when they can tell he\u2019s drunk, \u2018All right, here comes Timmy. We got to go.'\u201dCook testified that Paul had stripped down to his boxer shorts on the boat, despite the 40-degree weather.In addition to the felony charges Paul was facing, Mallory\u2019s mother, Renee Beach, filed a civil suit against the family patriarch Randolph Murdaugh III \u2014 who died from cancer on June 10, just three days after the murders \u2014 as well as Alex and Buster Murdaugh, Paul\u2019s older brother. The suit alleges that Buster allowed Paul to use his ID to buy alcohol before the crash. A hearing had been scheduled for June 10 but is now postponed.The civil suit came shortly after Alex had settled another wrongful death claim. In February 2018, 57-year-old Gloria Satterfield died as a result of a \u201ctrip and fall,\u201d according to <a href=\"https://www.fitsnews.com/2020/10/20/sc-fatal-boat-crash-lawsuit-murdaughs-refuse-to-settle-withhold-financial-records-from-victims-family/\">documents</a> obtained by Mandy Matney at FITSNews. Her family settled for $500,000.Court documents don\u2019t make clear where Satterfield died but local reporting indicates she was a housekeeper for the Murdaughs and that <a href=\"https://www.briceherndonfuneralhome.com/obituary/Gloria-Satterfield\">her obituary</a> mentions the family.The Murdaughs have also been relentlessly targeted around town and on social media, without proof, in the haunting death of 19-year-old Stephen Smith. Early on the morning of July 8, 2015, the <a href=\"https://www.fitsnews.com/2021/06/18/a-slap-in-the-face-update-in-the-stephen-smith-case-and-murdaugh-murders/\">young gay man from Hampton was found dead</a> in the middle of a rural road outside town. His skull was partially crushed and bloodied. There was a gaping hole in his forehead, and his shoulder had been dislocated.Stephen\u2019s mother Sandy Smith, 55, who lives in a trailer at the end of a dirt road, told The Post she\u2019s been <a href=\"https://www.augustachronicle.com/article/20151124/NEWS/311249889\">fighting publicly</a> for six years to find out what happened to her son. \u201cI\u2019ll never stop fighting to find out what happened to Stephen,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was my rock star.\u201dThe Post reviewed part of a thick police file on the case at her home. <a href=\"https://www.fitsnews.com/2021/06/18/a-slap-in-the-face-update-in-the-stephen-smith-case-and-murdaugh-murders/\">Documents obtained by Matney</a> from the South Carolina Highway Patrol reveal that police received at least one anonymous tip connecting a member of the Murdaugh family to the Stephen Smith case.Sandy and Todd Proctor, a former South Carolina Highway Patrol detective who was part of a team that investigated Stephen\u2019s death, believe the Murdaughs had some involvement, but the two have no evidence. No one in the family was charged or considered a formal suspect in the case.Despite her tenacity, few think Sandy will ever find out the truth about what happened to her son.\u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about that area of the state,\u201d Proctor said, \u201cit\u2019s a place time has left behind.\u201dMaybe. But the Murdaughs\u2019 comfortable life out of the spotlight may be over forever now that the outside world \u2014 including network TV reporters doing live shots outside SLED offices last week \u2014 has intruded.Still, locals don\u2019t count them out.\u201cThese are good ol\u2019 boys but they\u2019re really smart good ol\u2019 boys,\u201d Gabby Thomas said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re not all bad, neither.

Blinken described the flag \u2014 which incorporates a black, brown, light blue, pink and white chevron into the traditional rainbow-colored pride flag \u2014 as \u201ca symbol that encompasses the diversity and intersectionality of LGBTQI persons and communities around the world.\u201dThe secretary said the flag would be flown for three days beginning June 26, the anniversary of the 2015 Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges that legalized gay marriage nationwide. The final day of the tribute, June 28, marks the 52nd anniversary of the beginning of the Stonewall riots in Greenwich Village.Blinken also said he had given ambassadors around the world permission to fly the pride flag if they desired. In June 2019, the Trump administration denied requests from US embassies in at least four countries \u2014 Brazil, Germany, Israel and Latvia \u2014 to fly the flag during that month\u2019s festivities.\u201cWhen it comes to the American flagpole, and American embassies, and capitals around the world, one American flag flies,\u201d then-<a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/06/11/pence-defends-barring-rainbow-flag-at-us-embassies-during-pride-month/\">Vice President Mike Pence</a> said at the time. \u201cWhen we\u2019re trying to advance, defend, support the protection of LGBTQI persons around the world, we want to make sure that we\u2019re doing this in a way that takes into account the specific situation, conditions in a given country,\u201d Blinken said Monday. \u201cBut in every single country where we\u2019re represented, our chiefs of mission, our ambassadors, our charges \u2014 whoever\u2019s in charge \u2014 have the authority to fly the pride flag on an exterior, external-facing pole at the embassy.\u201cAnd I think that\u2019s hugely important because this is, again, the strength, the power of our own example, the willingness to speak up, to speak out, to show the strength of our own diversity, including at our embassies, I think sends a hugely important message.\u201dLast month, US embassies around the world <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/05/25/us-embassies-fly-blm-flags-to-remember-george-floyd/\">displayed Black Lives Matter flags</a> to mark the anniversary of the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin.

    "2021 - 3537": "The Vatican is pushing Italy to block a proposed anti-homophobia law making its way through the European country\u2019s parliament over concerns it\u2019ll clash with <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/03/15/vatican-bars-catholic-priests-from-blessing-same-sex-unions/\">Catholic practices</a>, reports said.Archbishop Paul Gallagher wrote a letter to Italian government officials last week looking for changes to the so-called Zan Law, which would criminalize discrimination and violence against LGBTQ people as well as disabled people and women, <a href=\"https://www.corriere.it/cronache/21_giugno_22/vaticano-ddl-zan-legge-testo-b13294ba-d2d0-11eb-9207-8df97caf9553.shtml?cx_testId=21&amp;cx_testVariant=cx_1&amp;cx_artPos=1#cxrecs_s\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Corriere della Sera first reported</a>.Gallagher allegedly said the law, as written, would violate a treaty between the sovereign Vatican and Italy dating back to 1984 that gave \u201cfull freedom\u201d of the church to \u201ccarry out\u201d its mission, <a href=\"https://www.thecatholictelegraph.com/vatican-intervenes-in-proposed-anti-homophobia-law-in-italy/75721\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to The Catholic Telegraph</a>.That 1984 agreement was an update to the 1929 Lateran Pacts, the Telegraph said.Critics said it was unusual for the Vatican to insert itself so directly into Italian government affairs.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time the church has done something like this,\u201d Robert Mickens, editor of Catholic newspaper La Croix, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/22/vatican-urges-italy-to-stop-anti-homophobia-law\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">told the Guardian</a>. \u201cThey\u2019re worrying about being fined for hate speech.\u201dThe new law would create a \u201cNational Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia\u201d and the Vatican has sought to ensure Catholic schools are exempted,<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-57570467\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> the BBC reported</a>. Democratic Party member Alessandra Zan, whom the bill is named for, said it comes with religious exemptions.Zan tweeted in Italian that \u201cthere can be no foreign interference\u201d in the work of parliament.The church has had a softening position on the LGBTQ community but doesn\u2019t recognize gay marriages or offer adoption to same sex couples, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/vatican-wants-changes-italy-draft-law-against-homophobia-2021-06-22/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Reuters reported.</a>\u201cWhile the Vatican has often condemned discrimination and violence against gays, it has also expressed concern about any type of gender theory that would blur or eliminate the differences between men and women,\u201d Reuters said.Matteo Salvini, leader of the right-leaning Northern League, sided with the Vatican on the issue. The group was in favor of anti-discrimination and anti-violence measures, he said.\u201cBut we are against any censorship or trials for those who believe that mother, father and family are at the heart of our society,\u201d Salvini said, according to Reuters.Others criticized the intervention, including an atheist group called the Union of Atheists and Agnostic Rationalists.\u201cThe government has the political and moral obligation to not only just resist pressure but to unilaterally denounce this unprecedented interference in state affairs,\u2019\u2019 the group said in a statement to the Associated Press.The law passed the parliament\u2019s lower chamber but remains in discussion in the Italian Senate.<em>With Post wires</em>",
    "2021 - 4881": "A run-of-the-mill <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/03/23/grassley-highlights-gun-owner-diversity-at-a-time-with-uncertain-police-response/\">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> hearing became bad-tempered Wednesday, with Sen. <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/03/24/senators-back-off-vow-to-withhold-support-for-biden-cabinet-nominees/\">Mazie Hirono</a> (D-Hawaii) accusing <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/06/22/climate-protesters-arrested-outside-ted-cruzs-houston-home/\">Sen. Ted Cruz</a> (R-Texas) of \u201cmansplaining\u201d after he referenced her in a question to a nominee about the doctrine of judicial originalism.During the hearing to consider U.S. District Judge Gustavo Gelpi\u2019s nomination to the First Circuit Court of Appeals, Cruz told the nominee that Hirono had stated \u201cthat you refused to commit to originalism because originalism would prevent [case] outcomes that she supports \u2026 she doesn\u2019t want judges who will follow the original understanding of the Constitution.\u201d\u201cIs it right that you don\u2019t intend to follow the original understanding of the Constitution?\u201d asked Cruz.\u201cSenator, as I mentioned to an earlier question, I will apply originalism. That is one of the factors, or the tests, that the Supreme Court has laid out for judges to follow and I cannot ignore it. I have to follow originalism in the cases where it is appropriate,\u201d answered Gelpi.When Cruz attempted to ask a follow-up question, he was cut off from the chair by Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.), who told Cruz his time had expired and recognized Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.)\u201cYou know, this is a committee where we\u2019ve had a little bit of comity,\u201d Cruz began, \u201cand I recognize Senator Ossoff is new, but we generally don\u2019t have the chairman trying to jump in thirty seconds in, and I recognize the chairman does not want these questions answered \u2013\u201c. At that point, Ossoff called for order, repeatedly banging his gavel as Padilla and Hirono both sought to be recognized. \u201cSenator Ossof desperately does not want these questions answered,\u201d Cruz added.When Hirono was recognized for a \u201cpoint of personal privilege,\u201d she said: \u201cI would request that my colleague, Sen. Cruz, not misstate what I\u2019m saying. You know what, all this mansplaining, please stop.\u201dAs Ossoff tried again to recognize Padilla, Cruz challenged Hirono.\u201cWhat was mischaracterized, Senator Hirono? You just said I mischaracterized something,\u201d the Texan said before he was cut off by Ossoff pounding his gavel.\u201cI\u2019m very proud you have a gavel, but a point of personal privilege,\u201d Cruz rebuked Ossoff. \u201cSenator Hirono just said I mischaracterized something she said. So I\u2019m asking her to explain what was mischaracterized. You\u2019re welcome to explain what was mischaracterized.\u201dAfter Ossoff allowed Hirono to respond, the Hawaii Democrat said: \u201cThe thing with my colleague is, he always has to get the last word and that is a fact.\u201d\u201cI do not object to originalism as applied because it results in decisions that I don\u2019t agree with,\u201d she continued. \u201cI disagree with the way that the Court proceeded \u2013 some of the members of the court and how they proceed with originalism to get to the results that they want. So, that\u2019s it.\u201d\u201cIs it not accurate that you said you thought originalism shouldn\u2019t be followed because it would lead to a different result in <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2015/06/26/tears-of-joy-for-widowed-plaintiff-in-gay-marriage-case/\"><em>Obergefell</em> [<em>v. Hodges</em>]</a> and a different result in <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/05/21/overturning-roe-v-wade-could-make-the-us-politically-healthier/\"><em>Roe</em> [<em>v. Wade</em>]</a>?\u201d Cruz asked. \u201cIs that not what you said?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Hirono answered. \u201cSome of the court members apply originalism. Not all of them do, and that is why, in some instances, they have been in the minority. Maybe not so much now.\u201d At that point, Cruz let the matter drop. Wednesday was not the first time Cruz and Hirono had clashed in the committee room. <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/08/04/ted-cruz-convenes-senate-hearing-on-antifa-terror-attacks/\">This past August</a>, Hirono objected to Cruz convening a Judiciary subcommittee hearing on \u201cterror attacks\u201d by members of the far-left group Antifa. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/06/22/travel-portland-ad-pitches-faith-in-the-future-amid-unrest/\">seen in Portland, Oregon</a>, is peaceful protesters in need of protection from federal officers,\u201d Hirono said. \u201cThe hearing we should be having is one called the right of the people peaceably assemble without being beaten up by unidentifiable federal agents.\u201dHirono then <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-senator-mazie-hirono-walks-out-ted-cruz-antifa-hearing\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">left the hearing early</a>, telling Cruz: \u201cI hope this is the end of this hearing, Mr. Chairman, and that we don\u2019t have to listen to any more of your rhetorical speeches.\u201d",
    "2021 - 3529": "That\u2019s some timing, Joe. Kamala Harris\u2019 first trip to the US-Mexico border as vice president was overshadowed Friday when President Biden started speaking at a different event just seven minutes into her highly anticipated press conference.Harris began her remarks at 1:50 pm eastern time. But at 1:57 pm, Biden rolled up to his own event at the White House to sign into law a national memorial to the victims of the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting.The White House often works to ensure that major news events don\u2019t overlap to allow officials and reporters to focus on one at a time \u2014 but the split-screen Friday appeared to be by design. The events were scheduled to begin just five minutes apart and both started late.It\u2019s unclear if the timing conflict was intended to distract from Harris\u2019 trip to El Paso, Texas, or it the conflict was simply the result of poor planning. Reporters covering the White House already were fuming about planning for Biden\u2019s trip this month to Europe, where press was repeatedly denied access at stops in England, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/06/14/biden-excludes-us-reporters-from-very-good-erdogan-meeting/\">Belgium </a>and <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/06/16/biden-appears-amused-watching-russians-shove-us-reporters/?preview_id=18538382\">Switzerland</a>.During her remarks in El Paso, Harris claimed that there\u2019s been <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/06/25/kamala-harris-touts-progress-at-border-despite-record-surge-under-biden/\">\u201cextreme progress\u201d</a> in stemming the flow of migration \u2014 despite the fact that border apprehensions hit <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/06/09/border-stops-top-180k-in-single-month-for-first-time-in-21-years/\">a 21-year monthly high</a> in May. Biden offered a more somber delivery as he commemorated the 49 people murdered at the gay club in Orlando, Fla., by a man pledging allegiance to the Islamic State group.\u201cJust over five years ago, the Pulse nightclub, a place of acceptance and joy, became a place of unspeakable pain and loss, and we will never fully recover, but we will remember,\u201d Biden said, joined by some of the survivors.Shortly afterward, Biden hosted a more jubilant gay pride month celebration \u2014 as Harris jetted to her home state California for the weekend.\u201cOur presence here this afternoon makes a simple strong statement: Pride is back at the White House,\u201d Biden said to applause.Although former President Donald Trump was described by his aides at the first US president<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/quicktake/status/1134632758737866753\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> to take office approving of same-sex marriage</a>, Trump took a relatively low-key approach to celebrating June as gay pride month. Trump launched a diplomatic push to decriminalize homosexuality in other countries and in 2019, he issued a pride-month statement hailing the \u201coutstanding contributions that LGBT people have made to our great Nation.\u201d He also named the first gay person to a Cabinet level job \u2014 Ric Grenell, who was acting director of national intelligence.But Trump also drew fire from activists, including for ordering the military to ban transgender people in 2017.Biden said at the gay-pride celebration that on Friday he hosted a belated birthday celebration featuring cupcakes for Chasten Buttigieg, the husband of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who is the first gay Senate-confirmed cabinet member.\u201cThis month, pride flags are flying\u2026 in more than over 130 US embassies around the world,\u201d Biden said to cheers."
