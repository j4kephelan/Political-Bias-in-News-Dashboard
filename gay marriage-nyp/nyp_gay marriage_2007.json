    "2007 - 1899": " WASHINGTON \u2013 At a hearing with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Queens Rep. Gary Ackerman yesterday slammed the Pentagon for firing Middle East translators who were gay \u2013 and cracked jokes about a \u201cplatoon of lesbians\u201d in Baghdad.   Ackerman, a senior Democratic member of the House International Relations Committee, was questioning Rice at a hearing about the military\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy on gays.   He accused the Pentagon of firing military linguists fluent in Arabic and in the Iranian language Farsi who turned out to be gay.   \u201cFor some reason, the military seems more afraid of gay people than they are against terrorists,\u201d he said.   Then Ackerman went into a joke that elicited a few laughs but also awkward groans.   \u201cThey\u2019re very brave with the terrorists,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if the terrorists ever got a hold of this information, they would get a platoon of lesbians to chase us out of Baghdad.\u201d   Rice smiled politely, but Ackerman continued with his vaudeville riffs.   \u201cCan we marry up those two \u2013 or maybe that\u2019s [not] the right word,\u201d he said, referencing the gay-marriage debate, to some laughter.   \u201cCan we have some kind of union of those two issues?\u201d he asked, in another pun.   Rice humored his request that the State Department consider hiring some of the unemployed ex-military linguists, promising to look at the issue.   Far from shying away from the episode, Ackerman\u2019s office sent out a press release with the transcript.   It wasn\u2019t the only time Rice\u2019s testimony before a congressional panel led a lawmaker to make a spectacle.   Last month, Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) claimed Rice couldn\u2019t comprehend the burdens on U.S. troops since she is single.   \u201cYou\u2019re not going to pay a particular price, as I understand it, with an immediate family,\u201d she scolded Rice.<em><a class=\"a10blb\" href=\"mailto:geoff.earle@nypost.com\">geoff.earle@nypost.com</a></em>",
    "2007 - 961": "Two men were legally united in a civil union in New Jersey just after midnight \u2013 the first gay couple to take advantage of the state\u2019s new same-sex equal-rights law, which took effect today.   \u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous step forward, but we want more,\u201d said Steven Goldstein, head of the gay-rights group Garden State Equality, who entered into the union with Daniel Gross.   \u201cIt is progress but it\u2019s not the final goal.\u201d   Goldstein said he hopes gay couples can one day legally marry in Jersey, as they can in Massachusetts.   The ceremony was held at 12:04 a.m. at the Teaneck office of state Sen. Loretta Weinberg, who co-authored the legislation.   A judge last October ruled that lawmakers can decide whether to allow gay marriages or civil unions for gays. Weinberg pushed the latter because it was more likely to pass.   Goldstein and Gross have been together for 15 years. In 2002, they were legally married in Canada and had a civil-union ceremony in Vermont.",
    "2007 - 2637": "Rudy Giuliani\u2019s liberal views could wreck the GOP, John McCain is an \u201cunreliable leader,\u201d Hillary Rodham Clinton is just like France \u2013 and Mitt Romney has \u201ctoo-perfect\u201d hair, according to an internal Romney campaign report. The blistering strategy report, a 77-page Power-Point presentation, reveals concerns that the former Massachusetts governor is prone to flip-flopper charges, and lists opponents\u2019 vulnerabilities that are ripe for exploiting. The document could be damaging to Romney, several GOP insiders said, further hurting his efforts to try to climb to the top tier in the polls alongside Giuliani and McCain. Giuliani is described as an outside-Washington \u201crock star and truth teller\u201d who \u201cearned the nation\u2019s trust for his leadership\u201d after 9/11, according to the Boston Globe, which obtained the report. But he\u2019s also described as a \u201cone-dimensional Lone Ranger whose social views \u2013 he supports abortion rights and civil unions for gay couples \u2013 could destroy the \u2018GOP brand.\u2019 \u201c \u201cWe can\u2019t disqualify Dems like Hillary on social issues ever again\u201d if Giuliani wins, the notes say. They highlight the ex-mayor\u2019s \u201cethical issues,\u201d such as his ties to disgraced Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, and alludes to his \u201cpersonal political liabilities\u201d \u2013 apparently his three marriages. McCain is a maverick war hero famed for \u201cstraight talk,\u201d the document says, but he\u2019s \u201ctoo close to [the Democratic] Left\u201d and is an \u201cuncertain, erratic, unreliable leader in uncertain times,\u201d the report says. Another major point throughout the report is criticism of Europe \u2013 especially France \u2013 saying, \u201cThat\u2019s where Hillary and Dems would take us. Hillary = France.\u201d The report looks at ways to make Romney a breakout \u201cbrand,\u201d and concedes it will be tough for him to do that with both Giuliani and McCain in the race. It expresses concern about Romney\u2019s well-coiffed mane being \u201ctoo perfect.\u201d It also says he can put distance between himself and President Bush by highlighting \u201cintelligence.\u201d Romney spokesman Kevin Madden said, \u201cOutside consultants routinely offer input and analysis \u2013 both solicited and unsolicited \u2013 on the dynamics of a political campaign all the time. But we cannot and will not verify any documents that are not marked Romney for President Inc.\u201d The Giuliani and McCain campaigns declined comment, and McCain aides said he\u2019s focused on serious issues such as Iraq. Clinton spokesman Blake Zeff said, \u201cGiven his propensity for flip-flopping, if Mr. Romney doesn\u2019t like France today, he\u2019ll probably decide to move there tomorrow.\u201d<a class=\"a10blb\" href=\"mailto:maggie.haberman@nypost.com\">maggie.haberman@nypost.com</a>",
    "2007 - 1329": "One-third of voters take issue with a presidential candidate who supports gun control or has been married three times like Rudy Giuliani, a new Time magazine poll shows.   The numbers indicate potential potholes for the current Republican front-runner as his bid for president kicks into gear.   According to the survey, 30 percent couldn\u2019t back a candidate who favors gun control, while another 35 percent have trouble with someone with three marriages.   That includes 48 percent of \u201cborn-again\u201d white Christians.   But the survey also shows 56 percent don\u2019t know Giuliani\u2019s marital history, 68 percent don\u2019t know his stand on gun control (he\u2019s been saying it\u2019s a state matter), and nearly 80 percent don\u2019t accurately know where he is on gay marriage (he\u2019s against it) or abortion rights (he favors it).   That suggests Giuliani is partly an unknown quantity nationally \u2013 although the poll is the latest one to show him with a double-digit lead over Arizona Sen. John McCain, beating him 38 percent to 24 percent.   McCain made clear yesterday he will battle hard, telling Dave Letterman he\u2019s running, and hitting Giuliani\u2019s home turf to be honored at an Irish-American event in Midtown.   Giuliani barely leads Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, 47 percent to 44 percent, according to the poll of 1,144 registered voters nationwide.",
    "2007 - 1240": "  WASHINGTON \u2013 Rudy Giuliani is surging ahead of such GOP big guns as Sen. John McCain for the GOP presidential nomination, a poll shows.   The Newsweek poll suggests that Republicans and social conservatives are so far either tolerant or unaware of the ex-mayor\u2019s liberal views on gay marriage and abortion.   Giuliani leads McCain by 59 to 34 percent and Mitt Romney by 70 to 20 percent. In a late-January Newsweek poll, Giuliani\u2019s led McCain by 48 to 44 percent.   According to the poll, 82 percent of registered Republicans say a candidate\u2019s marital history is not an important consideration. Giuliani has been married three times.   And while most say they\u2019re unfamiliar with Giuliani\u2019s stance on numerous social issues, when informed of his positions, the voters claim not to mind.   Giuliani also showed strongly in a straw poll taken at the Conservative Political Action Committee\u2019s annual conference yesterday. He came in second, just four percent behind Romney but five percent ahead of McCain.   Giuliani also wins when first and second choices are combined, topping Romney by five percent.   \u201cIt\u2019s clear he\u2019s a very strong candidate, even with conservatives, despite his record,\u201d said Heather Smith, of Young Voters Strategies.

    "2007 - 3412": "City high-school students are taking a \u201cTrojan\u201d course \u2013 and it\u2019s not about ancient Greek warfare.   Public high schools ordered 254,000 condoms last year, handing them out to lusty high-school students to encourage safe sex, The Post has learned.   That figure is equivalent to providing one condom for each high-school student.   The Department of Education\u2019s HIV/AIDS Condom Availability Program is independent of the Health Department\u2019s new initiative to hand out 26 million subway-themed condoms to New Yorkers.   The rubbers handed out in school \u201chealth resource rooms\u201d don\u2019t cost a dime. The Church &amp; Dwight Co., makers of Trojans, has donated 350,000 condoms a year to the school system for the last 10 years, a Department of Education spokeswoman said. That comes to 3.5 million rubbers.   The DOE identified 17 schools that ordered more than 3,000 condoms during the 2005-2006 school year \u2013 including Bronx HS of Science, the HS for Environmental Studies in Manhattan, Lincoln HS in Brooklyn, Port Richmond HS of Staten Island and Bryant HS in Queens.   At Bronx Science, students certainly know where the rubber room is.   \u201cThere are bulletin boards near the gym that have notices on them about condom availability,\u201d said Miko Yu, a 17-year-old senior from the Lower East Side. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s better to be safe.\u201d   She said some students might be less embarrassed getting them in the school health room than in a pharmacy.   One teacher at Port Richmond HS was dismayed that his school\u2019s students were known more for romping with rubbers than academic achievement. \u201cIs that what we\u2019re known for? Handing out condoms? It\u2019s good to know we\u2019re ahead of everyone else. It\u2019s ludicrous,\u201d said the veteran instructor, who requested anonymity.   While Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas Frieden has launched an aggressive marketing campaign to promote the new \u201cNYC\u201d condoms, he has steered clear of the schools. Frieden and DOE officials said they don\u2019t anticipate any change in school-condom policy, which would likely require school-board approval   Under the current policy, parents can sign a form barring their kids from receiving condoms in school, as long as their kids are under 18.   The Archdiocese of New York opposes the school condom policy as immoral and permissive.   \u201cThe best way to prevent the spread of disease is abstinence before marriage and fidelity within marriage, and our schools would be better served by teaching that,\u201d said Joseph Zwilling, spokesman for Edward Cardinal Egan.   But HIV-prevention advocates said the school condom policy is too timid. The number of condoms that schools ordered from the department dropped to 254,000 last year, compared to 347,000 the year before, department figures show.   \u201cThere is a consensus that the schools can do a better job,\u201d said a spokeswoman for Gay Men\u2019s Health Crisis.   DOE spokeswoman Margie Feinberg said orders fluctuate from year to year and maintained that the condom program has been a success overall. And the DOE took actions this year to bolster the program.   \u201cCondom availability training is offered more frequently than in past years and every effort is made to accommodate the individual schools\u2019 needs. Under the availability program, high schools have been receiving additional support and assistance,\u201d Feinberg said.<em><a class=\"a10blb\" href=\"mailto:carl.campanile@nypost.com\">carl.campanile@nypost.com</a></em>",
    "2007 - 2783": " WASHINGTON \u2013 Hillary Rodham Clinton is breaking with her husband on gays in the military, calling for the \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy to be replaced by show and tell.   Speaking to the nation\u2019s leading gay-rights group in an unannounced speech, the Democratic White House front-runner vowed to throw open the closet door for gays who want to serve in the military.   \u201cThis policy doesn\u2019t just hurt gays and lesbians, it hurts all our troops, and this to me is a matter of national security, and we\u2019re going to fix it,\u201d Clinton told the Human Rights Campaign.   \u201cI am proud to stand by your side,\u201d Clinton said in the keynote speech Friday, which was not announced publicly.   Clinton, who has drawn criticism from the gay community for supporting civil unions but not gay marriage, discussed her support for same-sex unions and equality for gays.   Asked twice at a campaign stop in Iowa yesterday why she kept her speech in the closet, Clinton said, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask my campaign.\u201d   The Human Rights Campaign let the cat out of the bag by posting a video of the speech on its Web site.   A Human Rights Campaign spokesman said keynote speeches to the group are \u201calways closed to the press, and we wanted to make [the remarks] available for people to see.\u201d   Clinton spokesman Blake Zeff said, \u201cWe\u2019re delighted that the speech at HRC\u2019s board meeting, which is traditionally closed to press, was posted on their Web site within hours.\u201d   When he was president, Bill Clinton infuriated many in the gay community by not backing efforts to allow openly gay individuals to serve in the military and instead pushing the \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy.   The former first lady publicly opposed the policy in 1999 as she launched her first New York Senate bid, and on Friday told the Human Rights Campaign her commitment to gay rights would continue.   \u201cI want you to know that just as you always have an open door to my Senate office, you will always have an open door to the White House, and together we can continue this journey,\u201d she told the group.   Clinton\u2019s prime rivals for the Democratic nomination, Barack Obama and John Edwards, have also called for the repeal of \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell.\u201d   David Smith, a former aide to Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) and now a Human Rights Campaign vice president, said Clinton\u2019s speech was \u201cvery well received,\u201d but added the group won\u2019t be endorsing a presidential candidate \u201canytime soon.\u201d   Meanwhile yesterday, Clinton campaigned in the kickoff caucus state of Iowa.   She praised the state, where the alternative fuel ethanol is blossoming into big business, saying \u201chistory books will be traced back to Iowa, because you were ahead of the curve.\u201d<em><a class=\"a10blb\" href=\"mailto:ian.bishop@nypost.com\">ian.bishop@nypost.com</a></em>",
    "2007 - 1477": " WASHINGTON \u2013 Rudy Giuliani angled to shore up his conservative standing yesterday by rolling out his newest presidential campaign supporter: Southern social conservative Sen. David Vitter.   Vitter, a Louisiana Republican who opposes abortion, gay marriage and gun control, was introduced yesterday as Giuliani\u2019s Southern regional chairman and immediately assured conservatives that America\u2019s Mayor\u2019s isn\u2019t running \u201cto advance any liberal social agenda.\u201d   Meanwhile, as Giuliani moved to lock up the GOP base, a new CNN/Opinion Research poll showed him opening a double-digit lead over chief rival John McCain.   The national survey of 401 Republicans found Giuliani pulling in 34 percent, compared to the slumping Arizona senator\u2019s 18 percent. Ex-Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and ex-House Speaker Newt Gingrich each checked in at 9 percent.   The low-profile Vitter is Giuliani\u2019s first major backer from south of the Mason-Dixon Line, where Giuliani\u2019s moderate brand of Republicanism traditionally doesn\u2019t hunt.   But Vitter said the leadership Giuliani displayed on 9/11 trumped any social shortcomings. That trait is one many Louisianans believe was lacking among state and federal officials during Hurricane Katrina.   \u201cRudy has the strong, unwavering leadership and sound judgment we need in this time of war and terrorist threat,\u201d Vitter said in a news conference in Washington. <em><a class=\"a10blb\" href=\"mailto:ian.bishop@nypost.com\">ian.bishop@nypost.com</a></em>"
