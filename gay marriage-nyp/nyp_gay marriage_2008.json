    "2008 - 5918": "ALBANY \u2013 I saw many signs early on that <a class=\"legacy-link\">Eliot Spitzer</a> was to politics what Sinclair Lewis\u2019 Elmer Gantry was to religion \u2013 a consummate hypocrite \u2013 but few, if any, of his governmental colleagues (and even fewer members of the largely fawning press corps) appeared able to see it as well.   To many of them, Spitzer could do no wrong.   They thought he was \u201cright\u201d on the issues that supposedly counted \u2013 government involvement in the private economy, hostility to Wall Street, gay marriage, even more campaign-finance restrictions (that favor the wealthy like Spitzer) and tighter gun laws.   So what did it matter if he turned into a boorish Richard Nixon when he unleashed the State Police on his leading Republican nemesis, Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, or repeatedly violated his self-proclaimed principles of government openness, public accountability and an end to influence of special interests?   Well, it mattered to me, and I didn\u2019t care if he was \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d on any particular issue.   I wrote Spitzer off as an agent of reform in the wake of the Dirty Tricks Scandal last July, when he repeatedly lied to the public and sought to smear me.   The Post broke the story July 5 and two weeks later, our findings were confirmed in a bombshell report by Attorney General Andrew Cuomo.   During the two weeks leading up to Cuomo\u2019s report, Spitzer and his aides did their best to spread rumors \u2013 in the political community and among the press \u2013 that I was merely carrying water for Bruno, lying about the facts, engaging in a crusade against a \u201cprogressive\u201d Democrat, and supposedly compromised by some unspecified relationship.   When Cuomo\u2019s report came out, Spitzer claimed his office had cooperated fully with the attorney general.   But the next day, we learned his chief-of-staff and his communications director hadn\u2019t cooperated at all. One may, in fact, have lied under oath.   In the weeks that followed, Spitzer repeatedly claimed to have answered every question about the scandal, and law-enforcement sources said he then pressured Albany DA David Soares to issue a report absolving him of responsibility.   Now there\u2019s considerable evidence that \u2013 surprise \u2013 Spitzer was in on the plot from the start.   His penchant for hypocrisy first started to became clear to me during his second term as attorney general.   As he declared war on Wall Street and other corporate abusers, Spitzer also declared war in effect on his own oath of office: a commitment to the state and federal constitutional guarantees of the presumption of innocence.   Time after time with high-profile corporate officials \u2013 most conspicuously, former American International Group CEO Maurice \u201cHank\u201d Greenberg \u2013 Spitzer railed on national television that his targets had broken the law.   But in most cases \u2013 after the damage to reputations was already done \u2013 no charges were brought.   From the start of his term, I spotted signs of trouble:   * Spitzer told me that \u2013 in a gesture of openness \u2013 he would lift some of the harsh \u201cFort Pataki\u201d security that had been imposed on the Capitol \u2013 well before the 9/11 attacks \u2013 to help then-Gov. George Pataki avoid contacts with the public.   Spitzer never did that, either.   * Another tip-off came when Spitzer \u201creformed\u201d the state\u2019s old Ethics and Lobbying commissions. But Spitzer\u2019s supposed reform put the formerly semi-independent agencies directly under the governor\u2019s control.   Asked why he had done that, Spitzer bluntly responded, \u201cBecause I wanted it\u201d that way.   The Ethics Commission\u2019s failure to thoroughly investigate the Dirty Tricks Scandal might explain the \u201cwisdom\u201d of his actions.   * Shortly before he took office, I heard Spitzer and his aides speak contemptuously of Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, the governor\u2019s most important legislative ally, as the battle over a new state comptroller emerged.   I thought at the time, \u201cIf he\u2019s going to war with Silver before he even takes office, how can he hope to win legislative support for his programs?\u201d   Got that one right!   * I saw and heard Spitzer\u2019s nastiness on Inauguration Day, Jan. 1, 2007, when he gratuitously insulted Pataki to his face by comparing his 12 years in office to the 20-year slumber of Rip Van Winkle.   Later that month, I spoke to a stunned Assembly Minority Leader, James Tedisco, who was still recovering from the verbal tongue lashing by the newly self-declared \u201cf- \u2013 -ing steamroller.\u201d   I thought again, \u201cHow can a governor who is battling Silver and declaring himself a steamroller ever hope to get along with what is, under our state Constitution, a co-equal branch of government?\u201d   * In February 2007, I followed Bruno on his Valentine\u2019s Day \u201cpeace mission\u201d as a 77-year-old Bruno marched down to the Executive Chamber with a bouquet of eight red roses meant as a friendship offering to the still-brand-new governor.   Spitzer greeted him with a gratuitously insulting crack that put the future target of the Dirty Tricks Scandal on notice that the governor was out to kill him politically. \u201cWhat are these, one for each of your members?\u201d asked the governor, referring to his determination to whittle down Bruno\u2019s even-then tenuous Senate majority.   * I certainly remember the repeated claims by Spitzer and his aides that the new governor would rein in the out-of-control influence of special-interest lobbyists that turned Albany under Pataki into a throwback to the days of Boss Tweed.   \u201cHe\u2019s not going to allow them. He\u2019s going to change all that,\u201d Spitzer\u2019s then-spokesman, Darren Dopp, told me on several occasions.   Now Dopp, after losing his job in the wake of the Dirty Tricks Scandal, works for megalobbyist Patricia Lynch, who just last Friday threw a $1,000-a-ticket breakfast in Manhattan for Spitzer.   To me, that said it all.<em><a class=\"a10blb\" href=\"mailto:fredric.dicker@nypost.com\">fredric.dicker@nypost.com</a></em>",

Pedersen \u2013 who is named in Matos McGreevey\u2019s court papers \u2013 agreed to talk about the alleged unconventional relationship after Dina sounded off to the media last week about Eliot Spitzer\u2019s sex scandal.   \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating to hear her call <a class=\"legacy-link\">Gov.

It\u2019s disgusting to watch her play the victim card.\u201d   The trio\u2019s trysts started after Pedersen was hired as a campaign driver when McGreevey was mayor of Woodbridge, NJ, the former chauffeur said.   \u201cWe called it the Friday Night Special,\u201d Pedersen said. The \u201cintense\u201d escapades, he said, usually began with a \u201ccouple of drinks\u201d at a local T.G.I. Friday\u2019s and culminated in \u201ca hard-core consensual sex orgy\u201d between the three of them at McGreevey\u2019s Woodbridge condo.   He said the action also spilled over to out-of-town business trips, during which Pedersen, a handsome, clean-cut Rutgers grad, would share a single hotel suite with Jim and Dina \u2013 right under the noses of other McGreevey staffers.   The threesomes began in the late 1990s, while Dina and Jim were dating, continued after their October 2000 marriage, and had ended by the time McGreevey was elected governor in November 2001, Pedersen said. \u201cHe liked watching me, and she would watch me while she was [performing sex acts] with Jim,\u201d Pedersen said. \u201cIn my opinion, me being a part of their sexual relationship enhanced it for both of them.\u201d   Pedersen, who lives with his girlfriend of several years, said he revealed the sexual shenanigans during the couple\u2019s divorce proceedings only because Dina\u2019s camp subpoenaed him. The former driver said he believes that Dina subpoenaed him as an end-run around her estranged hubby, to see what he would say if he was called on by McGreevey\u2019s side. Pedersen said he believes that Dina never expected him to talk about their trysts.   \u201cI would have kept my mouth shut about this forever, but she subpoenaed me, and now it\u2019s all going to come out at trial,\u201d Pedersen said. He added he expects to be called as one of the first witnesses at the trial.   Details of the lust triangle have been quashed once before, according to a source at now-disbanded Regan Books, which published McGreevey\u2019s 2006 memoir, \u201cThe Confession.\u201d   \u201cThere was a coy and gentle reference to a third person, but McGreevey took it out because he thought it was unnecessarily harmful,\u201d the insider said.   Pedersen said the threesome started as an \u201cidea\u201d he and McGreevey tossed around during the aide\u2019s long hours behind the wheel for the Woodbridge politician.   \u201cWe developed a good relationship \u2013 we were colleagues, but we were friends,\u201d Pedersen said, adding that once Dina and Jim\u2019s romance bloomed, she was often in the car with them headed to political events.   \u201cThere was a level of comfort that evolved into, eventually, hints of pushing it into this sexual realm,\u201d Pedersen said.   \u201cJim and I thought we could see if she would go for it \u2013 beyond just the hints in conversation.   \u201cSo one night, we came in. I went down to the basement bathroom, and when I came up, to my shock, she was basically undressed and on the loveseat with Jim. So I sat on the couch and watched and eventually joined in.   \u201cAnd that\u2019s how it got going,\u201d he said. \u201cWe came up with this nice little formula for making it work.\u201d   Sometimes, the trio took their show on the road, he said. On business trips \u2013 including to the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City \u2013 they shared one room, leaving others in the entourage baffled, he said.   \u201cIt became almost laughable \u2013 I would never have my own hotel room,\u201d Pedersen said. \u201cEveryone thought that this was weird, but we\u2019d just brush it off.\u201d   Pedersen\u2019s presence wasn\u2019t always welcomed by Matos McGreevey.   In her 2007 memoir, \u201cSilent Partner,\u201d she recounted her fury when he showed up, bags packed, to drive Jim and Dina to Montreal for the Valentine\u2019s Day weekend in 2000 during which McGreevey proposed to her. Matos McGreevey \u2013 who described Pedersen as \u201ca handsome college student . . . one of a crowd of guys in their 20s who always seemed to be around\u201d \u2013 said she wasn\u2019t happy when McGreevey told her the young buck was taking them to Canada.   \u201cWas he kidding?\u201d Dina wrote. \u201cI\u2019d really been looking forward to this weekend together. The two of us, not the three of us.   \u201cI dug my heels in,\u201d she continued, recounting that she told McGreevey, \u201cIf Teddy is going, I\u2019m not.\u201d   Said Pedersen, who wound up not making the trip, \u201cI think she knew he was gonna propose, and she knew if I went, there was going to be a threesome. She had the decency to say, \u2018Let\u2019s make this sort of special\u2019 and just the two of them.\u201d   But the strange relationship continued even after the McGreeveys wed in October 2000, Pedersen said. The Friday Night Special, he claimed, was replaced by a more subdued Saturday-morning routine.   \u201cI\u2019d go to the condo, and usually they\u2019d still be in bed,\u201d Pedersen said. \u201cI\u2019d sometimes go up, sit on the edge of the bed, rub Dina\u2019s legs through the comforter and go from there. Saturdays were a lot more low-key. Things hit their peak before the marriage. Afterward, there was this sort of soft landing, and it eventually tapered off and ended.\u201d   Asked why it stopped, Pedersen said, \u201cIn my mind, I figured, \u2018Dina\u2019s married. She doesn\u2019t have to play into it anymore.\u2019   \u201cShe sealed the deal, she got what she wanted, the nice life, the governor\u2019s mansion, and she would do everything in her power to keep it.\u201d   Neither Dina nor Jim McGreevey returned calls for comment. Lawyers for both said, \u201cNo comment.\u201d   In her memoirs, Dina insists she never knew McGreevey was gay.   \u201cNot only would I not knowingly have married a gay man, but I would never have allowed a gay man to father my child,\u201d she said. The former couple has a 6-year-old daughter, Jacqueline.   A former Democratic Party official who knows the couple said he \u201calways suspected something\u201d was going on between Jim McGreevey and Pedersen. But as for the reputed threesome with Dina?   \u201cThat\u2019s a complete shock,\u201d the source said. \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t believe it. She\u2019s not the smartest woman in the world, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s that stupid.\u201d   Jim McGreevey resigned as governor in 2004 after admitting he was gay and being accused of hiring a boyfriend, Golan Cipel, as his homeland-security adviser. The adviser has said he was sexually harassment.   Jim McGreevey filed for divorce last year. He and Dina are due back in divorce court Thursday.<a class=\"a10blb\" href=\"mailto:jeane.macintosh@nypost.com\">jeane.macintosh@nypost.com</a>",

I have no reason to lie,\u201d he declared.  \u201cIf she wasn\u2019t worried about me or what I might say why would she have ever subpoenaed me? That\u2019s the most important question. If she has nothing to hide why am I being subpoenaed?\u201d Pedersen said.  The former McGreevey companion, who said he frequently traveled on business with the couple and shared a single hotel room with them, asked, \u201cIf nothing was going on, why am I traveling with them? Why am I always with them?  \u201cAll the pieces are there. And she just doesn\u2019t want to admit it.\u201d",
    "2008 - 3345": "Former New Jersey Gov. Jim McGreevey yesterday said his driver did indeed ride shotgun in three-way sex romps with him and then-wife, Dina. \u201cThis happened,\u201d the gay former governor, 50, said in a stunning statement. \u201cThis happened in the past, and now we need to move on with our lives. Baby-faced former chauffeur Teddy Pedersen, 29, had detailed the trio\u2019s seamy reputed menage-\u00e0-trois in yesterday\u2019s Post, saying he believes he was used by the power couple in the bedroom to enhance McGreevey\u2019s performance \u2013 and that Dina must have realized her hubby was gay. Dina Matos McGreevey, now locked in a bitter divorce and custody battle with her ex, yesterday charged that Pedersen\u2019s claims are \u201ccompletely false and were prompted by Jim McGreevey.\u201d \u201cJim has had a close relationship with Pedersen since his days as mayor of Woodbridge and arranged jobs for Pedersen from that time through his years as governor and beyond,\u201d she said in an e-mail. \u201cThey have continued their relationship since Jim left office. This was obviously payback time for Pedersen.\u201d But Pedersen retorted that Dina is living in a dream world \u2013 the same one where she denied she knew her hubby was gay during their marriage. Matos McGreevey\u2019s main argument in the divorce war is that the former governor hid his sexuality from her and tricked her into a loveless marriage. \u201cDina is still in denial. It\u2019s time for her to face the truth,\u201d Pedersen told The Post yesterday. \u201cIf Dina wants to take a lie-detector test with me, I will sit down with her any time, any place,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only reason that I spoke to the media is because she dragged me into her divorce.\u201d The former driver said he revealed the lust triangle during a deposition to Dina\u2019s lawyers after her side deposed him. He said he believes that she wanted to see what he would say before McGreevey\u2019s side got a hold of him \u2013 but that she never expected him to spill the beans on their kinky \u201cFriday Night Special\u201d love sessions. \u201cI don\u2019t know how honest she was with her attorneys or herself, but she must have been worried about him [McGreevey] going public,\u201d Pedersen said. During his deposition, the handsome ex-driver said, \u201cDina was chuckling nervously all the way through, and most of the time, she kept her head down, staring at the desk. Her whole life was blowing up in her face in that room. \u201cBut her lawyer asked, and I told.\u201d A source familiar with the case said Dina denied the love trysts during her own deposition. Pedersen said he first met McGreevey while working the front desk at The Club at Woodbridge, a fitness center, in the late 1990s. The young man said he eventually was hired as a campaign driver for McGreevey \u2013 and their trio love trysts soon began.  Pedersen said the threesomes continued for about two years and included hot sessions during hotel stays, when he would share a room with the couple. A source familiar with booking trips for the tawdry threesome at Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino said he remembers the trio well. \u201cThey didn\u2019t book a separate room for Teddy. And he stayed in their suite,\u201d the source said. Pedersen said the romps ended by the time McGreevey was elected governor in November 2001. \u201cI\u2019m not gaining anything from this,\u201d Pedersen said of going public with details of the trio\u2019s trysts.

    "2008 - 2564": "HERE we go again. New York\u2019s accidental and temporary governor, David Pater son, cannot remember whether he engaged in energetic sex with a woman not his wife for two \u2013 or was it three? \u2013 years around the turn of this century.   I can remember the make, model and license plate numbers of my first three automobiles. But maybe it\u2019s me.   Paterson revealed yesterday the reason he can\u2019t get straight the frequency or duration of his loving ways: He was engaged in flings with a burgeoning population of strange and familiar women. Too many to count.   \u201cI didn\u2019t violate an oath,\u201d he actually said, as if the oath of marriage were a ticklish formality that one may easily trash \u2013 provided, as he insists, he did not spend state money to pleasure himself.   But wasn\u2019t Paterson catting around during times he should have been busy writing legislation or something? What duties are we, the taxpayers, paying these guys to perform?   Paterson\u2019s greatest sin is not that he was horny. Rather, he\u2019s cheap.   It\u2019s as if he were in competition with New Jersey\u2019s deposed gay governor, Jim McGreevey, who engaged in sexual m\u00e9nages \u00e0 trois with his wife and his hot, male driver following dinner at that fine wings-and-skins emporium, TGI Friday\u2019s.   Paterson\u2019s tastes were so low-rent, he made up with his wife, Michelle, with an intimate liaison at the same Manhattan Days Inn where he met with various women whose names escape.   Days Inn, David? Was Motel 6 booked?   There is one more thing you need to know about New York\u2019s latest middle-aged hound dog: He blames his wife.   \u201cI was pretty upset and I was kind of just angry and for a period of time I was using poor judgment,\u201d Paterson said, explaining why he had to be unfaithful.   \u201cI wasn\u2019t reckless. I was jealous over Michelle. But it was not Michelle\u2019s fault.\u201d Nice.   We are rapidly growing desensitized to chief executives whose carnal needs trump common sense. It appears that a state position and the ability to twist arms is all it takes for a public servant to get laid while on the clock.   Paterson admitted he helped a lover afflicted with an unspecified medical problem get special treatment at work. It seems a roll in the hay, and a word from the then-state senator, got the lady\u2019s problem fixed.   Lost in the hubbub of the latest Love Gov is the fact that the man had children \u2013 a boy who was between 5 and 7 when Paterson commenced his activities, plus a stepdaughter.   But you heard him. It\u2019s nobody\u2019s business.<a class=\"a10blb\" href=\"mailto:andrea.peyser@nypost.com\">andrea.peyser@nypost.com</a>",
    "2008 - 1584": "  Dina Matos McGreevey got her day off to a great start yesterday, taking daughter Jacqueline to school \u2013 before she and hubby Jim had their first court showdown since the bombshell claim that they had three-way sex romps with a male aide.   And that shocking allegation could be just \u201cthe tip of the iceberg\u201d of what\u2019s to come, a judge declared at a hearing yesterday.   Judge Karen Cassidy appeared to be referring to the startling claims by driver Theodore Pedersen when she spoke to the McGreeveys about the likely tenor of their scheduled May 6 divorce trial.   \u201cWe all know what happened this week,\u201d she said.   \u201cWhat evidence will likely be heard in this case, this week was just the tip of the iceberg.\u201d   Cassidy\u2019s statement set off a flurry of speculation that there might be more salacious testimony once the trial begins.   Dina has steadfastly denied the driver\u2019s allegations, which would undermine her claims that she didn\u2019t know that her husband was gay.   Jim, the former Jersey Love Gov, left office in 2004 after announcing he was a \u201cgay American\u201d and had an affair with a male staffer.   Cassidy did allow Matos McGreevey\u2019s claim of marriage fraud to go forward at yesterday\u2019s hearing, but would not allow her claim of emotional distress.   \u201cMr. McGreevey was not out to destroy her emotionally. There was no intention to hurt the defendant,\u201d Cassidy said.   Both McGreeveys carried Bibles with them as they sat an awkward 10 feet apart.   Additional Reporting by Cynthia R.

    "2008 - 1483": "  They were once happily married, but Star Jones and hubby Al Reynolds are now hoping to be gay divorc\u00e9s.   The former \u201cView\u201d diva quietly filed last month for an uncontested divorce from her investment-banker husband of three years, and a source close to the couple described the split as amicable.   There\u2019s \u201cno animosity \u2013 they\u2019re both sad,\u201d the source said, describing the parting pair as \u201cgood friends\u201d who \u201ctalk several times a week.\u201d   The split is also expected to go smoothly because there\u2019s \u201can airtight pre-nup\u201d in place, the source said.   Jones declined comment.   \u201cI\u2019m in Costa Rica with friends on an adventure tour,\u201d she told The Post.   In a statement to \u201cEntertainment Tonight,\u201d Jones said, \u201cThe dissolution of a marriage is a difficult time in anyone\u2019s life that requires privacy with one\u2019s thoughts. I have committed myself to handling this situation with dignity and grace and look forward to emerging from this period as a stronger and wiser woman.\u201d   Howard Bragman, a spokesman for Reynolds, said, \u201cWe\u2019re taking the high road. We\u2019re not playing this divorce out in the press.\u201d   If that holds true, it would be far different from how the two were married.   Jones, 46, frequently brought up Reynolds, 48, and her upcoming nuptials when she was a co-host of \u201cThe View,\u201d and used her position to solicit sponsors and garner freebies for their 500- person wedding.<em><a class=\"a10blb\" href=\"mailto:dareh.gregorian@nypost.com\">dareh.gregorian@nypost.com</a></em>"
