    "2005 - 2482": "THE moment was freakishly out of character. There, in the flesh, was unmistakably John Kerry \u2013 face taut and unmoving, makeup tan, hair at attention \u2013 and he performed an act that, for once, just might serve to benefit someone other than himself:   Kerry announced that he was unhooking his fingernails from the doorjamb of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. The man whose boundless ambition had long eclipsed his pride, his morality or common sense had, finally, come to his senses.   Kerry was stepping aside.   Thank you, Senator.   In the final analysis, the people \u2013 a clear majority of us \u2013 recognized Kerry for what he was. Here was the negative image of a genuine candidate, a man who won the Democratic nomination because he was not Howard Dean, then ran on the single-issue platform of \u201cI\u2019m not George Bush.\u201d   He was a man without a plan, a politician without a platform, a self-involved empty suit who offered not one single, coherent campaign promise, with the exception that he vowed to raise your taxes.   In the Senate, it was easier for Kerry to obscure his lack of ideas. There, he could profess to be the candidate for gay rights \u2013 while opposing gay marriage.   In the Senate, he could get away with voting in favor of the war in Iraq, then against equipping the troops, after reading a poll suggesting some Americans thought things were going badly in the Mideast.   When it suited him, he posed as a Vietnam War hero, though he was loath to explain how he once called his comrades baby-killers. And he never quite told us how he could ignore our allies in Israel, and live with himself.   He was the candidate of big government, who promised health care for all, while never saying how he would succeed where his predecessors failed, miserably.   In the end, being vague was not an option. It became clear that his priority was never the betterment of the people of this country. John Kerry existed for the glory of John Kerry.   On Election Day, the people spoke. The majority voted for someone imperfect, but a man they knew. This is a president we feel safer with. A man whose principles we might not always agree with. But better to stand for something than exist in a moral, spiritual, ideological void.   It took Kerry at least 12 hours before the message finally seeped in.   But Kerry came to his senses. He could not win, and drawing this thing out was not only wrong, it would certainly poll badly.   Senator, you may have a future in public service, after all. ",
    "2005 - 2819": "PRESIDENT BUSH won the White House because he understands it\u2019s hip to be square.   Bush knows what he stands for and connects with mainstream Americans across a cultural divide that Democrat John Kerry just can\u2019t reach.   The president won re-election far from the fancy Manhattan dinner tables where pampered liberals love to ridicule him as a dummy, out in rural and exurban areas where Americans still think it\u2019s right to talk about loving God and country.   He won in places where campaigning with Red Sox World Series hero Curt Schilling trumps Bruce Springsteen or Jon Bon Jovi any time, and Whoopi Goldberg was never seen as funny, even before her obscene anti-Bush rant at a Kerry cash bash.   He won in tiny towns where no one dreams of dining with Bush-hating billionaire George Soros, you don\u2019t need to borrow a gun to go goose hunting, and opposing gay marriage is seen as standing up for traditional values.   \u201cMost people in America don\u2019t windsurf and don\u2019t snowboard. Kerry\u2019s problem wasn\u2019t about his thoughts or issues as much as it was his inability to connect,\u201d said Democratic strategist David Doak.   \u201cDemocrats get in trouble with candidates from the liberal elite, of noblesse oblige, who talk about, \u2018Oh gee, I\u2019m going to help the poor people,\u2019 \u201d Doak added.   As he sees it, the Democratic Party is a mix of working people and often-wealthy liberals. But recently \u2013 with the notable exception of Bill Clinton \u2013 the party has chosen nominees who reflect an elite, out-of-touch mentality.   \u201cBill Clinton could go both ways. He was comfortable in trailer parks as well as Park Avenue. But he was a unique figure,\u201d Doak said. \u201cWe Democrats have got to find a way to reconnect with rural voters and more conservative voters.\u201d   The cultural disconnect explains why the Democratic party is evaporating in the South, where it just lost a stunning five Senate seats (counting Florida), and in socially conservative states like South Dakota, where Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle lost.   Daschle, desperate to hang onto his seat, even ran a TV ad that showed him hugging Bush after 9/11. Republicans hit back with an ad that showed Daschle ridiculing Bush in terms that a disdainful Manhattan liberal might happily use. South Dakotans love Bush \u2013 and rejected Daschle.   A central tenet of Bush political guru Karl Rove\u2019s strategy over the past four years has been to turn out 3 or 4 million conservative Christians who didn\u2019t vote in 2000. And he did. That was key to saving Ohio for Bush.   It\u2019s also a prime reason why as many Republicans as Democrats voted this time.   They\u2019re the kind of voters who see an extra $1,000 from the Bush tax cuts as real money, not chump change. And who think voting against $87 billion covering body armor and munitions in wartime isn\u2019t nuance, it\u2019s just wrong. ",
    "2005 - 3059": "Former President Bill Clinton, in his first comments on President Bush\u2019s re-election, yesterday urged Democrats not to \u201cwhine\u201d about the outcome, but to find a \u201cclear national message.\u201d   Clinton also said that Democrat John Kerry was hurt by the polarizing issue of gay marriage, which was legalized by Massachusetts\u2019 top court and put on the ballot in 11 states, and the surfacing of a tape from Osama bin Laden in the final days of the race.   Reminded of terrorism by the bin Laden tape, voters decided they didn\u2019t want to \u201cchange horses\u201d during a time of heightened concern over national security, Clinton said in a speech to the Urban Land Institute at the New York Hilton.   Clinton said Hispanic voters tilted to Bush because of terrorism fears, as did suburban \u201csoccer moms,\u201d who Clinton said turned into \u201cthe security moms of 2004.\u201d   He also said that while Democrats registered more new voters than Republicans, the Bush campaign did a better job of getting voters to the polls who were already registered but had not previously voted.   Despite the GOP victory, the former president \u2013 whose wife Hillary is already being mentioned as the top contender for the White House in 2008 \u2013 said Democrats \u201cshouldn\u2019t be all that discouraged\u201d by Kerry\u2019s defeat.   Clinton said it would be \u201ca mistake for our party to sit around and . . . whine about this and that or the other thing.\u201d   Clinton attributed Kerry\u2019s loss to the Democrats\u2019 failure to combat how they were portrayed by Republicans to small-town America.   \u201cIf we let people believe that our party doesn\u2019t believe in faith and family, doesn\u2019t believe in work and freedom, that\u2019s our fault,\u201d he said.   Democrats \u201cneed a clear national message, and they have to do this without one big advantage the Republicans have, which is they won\u2019t have a theological message that basically paints the other guy as evil,\u201d he said.   Clinton said the country was more divided than it was in 1968 and called for an end to the \u201cculture war.\u201d   In his hourlong speech Clinton, who had open-heart surgery in September, gave Bush and the Republicans full credit for the election victory.   \u201cThe Republicans had a clear message, a good messenger, great organization and great strategy,\u201d he said.   Clinton said Bush should use his second term to move toward less dependence on foreign oil.   \u201cThis election presents a great opportunity for President Bush and a great opportunity for Democrats, and the two are not necessarily in conflict,\u201d he said.   The biggest opportunity he noted was the prospect of an Israeli-Palestinian peace amid the impending demise of Yasser Arafat.   Peace in the region would \u201ctake enormous steam\u201d out of Islamic fundamentalist terrorism worldwide, Clinton said. \u201cThey would have to think of a new excuse to murder people.\u201d   WHY KERRY LOST   * Gay marriage issue favored Republicans   * GOP got inactive registered voters to the polls   * Democrats were portrayed as the party that didn\u2019t care about family, freedon, faith and work   * Osama bin Laden tape made security a top issue ",
    "2005 - 1742": "A bad dream that her father had lost his bid for re-election pushed privacy-conscious First Daughter Jenna Bush out on the campaign trial, Laura Bush reveals in a new interview.   The University of Texas graduate had the premonition at some point during her senior year and decided she couldn\u2019t just stand by as her father ran for a second term, the first lady told Newsweek magazine. \u201cIt was very moving to George,\u201d Laura said.   Soon after her nightmare, Jenna and her sister, Barbara, came along on one of Bush\u2019s campaign bus trips and contributed some much-needed humor to their dad\u2019s grueling re-election bid.   To Bush\u2019s delight, his daughters would read aloud signs criticizing him. Passing a sign that read \u201cYou suck,\u201d the three could barely control their laughter, Newsweek reports.   And although the 22-year-old twins\u2019 convention speech was met with near-unanimous jeers, the girls were able to brush it off quite easily and continue campaigning.   The girls\u2019 attitude was far different from Bush\u2019s first presidential run, when Jenna told her father, \u201cOh, I just wish you wouldn\u2019t run . . . It\u2019s going to change our life.\u201d   Meanwhile, just days after President Bush\u2019s re-election victory, soul-searching gay and lesbian advocates are wondering whether same-sex weddings tipped the scales to Republicans.   Exit polling showed \u201cmoral values\u201d were at the top of voters\u2019 concerns, especially in the 11 states where voters banned same-sex marriage \u2013 ballot amendments inspired by a slew of gay weddings in several states.   \u201cI think it hurt,\u201d said Rep. Barney Frank, a gay Democrat from Massachusetts, the state that set off a firestorm last November when its high court ruled gay couples could marry. <em>With Post Wire Services</em>",
    "2005 - 1623": " WASHINGTON \u2013 Karl Rove yesterday described John Kerry\u2019s flip-flop on paying for the war in Iraq as \u201ca gift that kept on giving\u201d and said Swift Boat attacks on Kerry worked because he made the war an issue.   Rove, the top political strategist for President Bush, also vowed a busy agenda \u2013 beginning with amending the Constitution to ban gay marriage, although two moderate Republicans quickly panned the idea.   Rove, appearing on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d also said Bush would quickly move to reform the tax code.   As for Kerry\u2019s claim during the campaign that he \u201cvoted for the $87 billion [for the Iraq war] before I voted against it,\u201d Rove said his reaction was one of \u201cdisbelief.\u201d   \u201cWe immediately turned it into . . . [an] ad that featured an ending with those words on it. And it\u2019s the gift that kept on giving,\u201d Rove said.   As for the Swift Boat Vets for Truth, who ripped Kerry as a liar, Rove said that Kerry himself made the attacks stick.   \u201cI think they were made important by the fact that Sen. Kerry, at his convention, really talked about not his forward-looking agenda or his service in the Senate, but really only about Vietnam,\u201d Rove said.   Speaking on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) both panned Bush\u2019s proposal to amend the Constitution to prevent gays from being married.   \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any evidence that suggests that a constitutional amendment is needed at this time,\u201d said Collins, who said it would be a mistake for Bush to push the effort.   Hagel added, \u201cI don\u2019t think you want to move the Constitution into that realm.\u201d   (p. 21 in metro)",
    "2005 - 2033": " ALBANY \u2013 Gov. Pataki\u2019s top political adviser has trashed President Bush, attacked the \u201cChristian right,\u201d and said Bush\u2019s re-election means Pataki can\u2019t become president in 2008.   The shocking comments by Arthur Finkelstein appeared in the Israeli daily newspaper Maariv, which also quoted the nationally known GOP consultant as saying that in the presidential election, \u201cthe Republican Party became the Christian right, the most radical in modern history ever.\u201d   Finkelstein, the one-time political guru to former U.S. Sen. Alfonse D\u2019Amato, is also described by Maariv writer Boaz Gaon as \u201chating\u201d Bush.   In the story, which ran last Friday, Finkelstein accused Bush of trying to \u201cdictate to America how to live and what to believe in.\u201d   Finkelstein, who has helped run several Israeli elections, is also described as claiming Bush is more interested in banning abortion than he is in winning the war in Iraq.   And Finkelstein, who told a Boston newspaper several years ago that he is homosexual, described Bush\u2019s campaign strategy as being more interested in banning gay marriages than in improving the American economy.   Finkelstein, who is credited with orchestrating Pataki\u2019s stunning upset victory over then-Gov. Mario Cuomo in 1994, told the newspaper Bush\u2019s victory is bad news for Pataki, a social liberal who supports abortion and gay rights, because it means the \u201cChristian right\u201d is in charge of the GOP.   Asked if Pataki could run for president in 2008, Finkelstein responded:   \u201cBush\u2019s victory not only establishes the power of the American Christian right in this candidacy, but in fact established its power to elect the next Republican president.\u201d   Finkelstein did not return calls seeking comment, and Pataki\u2019s camp did not return calls.   A prominent Republican familiar with the interview called Finkelstein\u2019s comments \u201ca big embarrassment for Pataki.   \u201cArthur isn\u2019t comfortable being a Republican anymore when he\u2019s so unhappy with our success and that\u2019s why he\u2019s so flamboyantly bashing the president.\u201d ",
    "2005 - 1726": " Gov. Pataki rebuked his longtime political adviser Arthur Finkelstein yesterday for saying President Bush had allowed the \u201cChristian right\u201d to take over the Republican Party.   \u201cArthur Finkelstein\u2019s assessment of the presidential campaign is simply wrong,\u201d said Pataki spokeswoman Lisa Stoll, in an unprecedented criticism of the governor\u2019s valued campaign strategist.   \u201cThe governor strongly disagrees and thinks the president ran an outstanding race, and he was proud to have an active role in the campaign,\u201d Stoll continued.   The Post disclosed yesterday that Finkelstein, a nationally known GOP consultant who was once the top political adviser to former U.S. Sen. Alfonse D\u2019Amato, had been highly critical of Bush and the president\u2019s campaign in an interview with the Israeli newspaper Maariv.   Finkelstein also contended in the interview that the \u201cChristian right\u201d coalition that helped re-elect Bush would make it impossible for liberal Republicans like Pataki to win their party\u2019s presidential nomination in four years.   \u201cBush\u2019s victory not only established the power of the American Christian right in this candidacy, but, in fact, established its power to elect the next Republican president,\u201d Finkelstein said.   Finkelstein also claimed that religious groups are more interested in banning abortion and prohibiting gay marriages then they are in winning the war in Iraq and improving the economy.   Meanwhile, Pataki, who raised a lot of money for the president\u2019s campaign, insisted he isn\u2019t interested in getting a job in the Bush administration.   \u201cI haven\u2019t wanted to. I supported the president because I believe in his policies and I believe in the president,\u201d he said.   (p. 2 in metro and sports extra) ",
    "2005 - 1563": "Partners of gay city workers could soon be eligible to receive pension benefits under a proposal being pushed by Mayor Bloomberg.   In a statement yesterday, the mayor is asking that the city\u2019s five pension systems recognize gay marriages performed in Massachusetts, Canada and elsewhere, as well as civil unions in Vermont.   State Comptroller Alan Hevesi determined last month that gay partners state government workers married in Canada are entitled to the same public pension benefits as married heterosexuals. After that ruling, Bloomberg sought an advisory opinion from city lawyers to see if the city pension boards could do the same.   \u201cThe corporation counsel has advised me that such recognition is legal and just,\u201d Bloomberg said.   \u201cI am forwarding the opinion to my representatives on the boards of the city\u2019s five pension systems and directing them to introduce resolutions to ensure that parties to these relations are treated in the same manner as parties to opposite-sex marriages.\u201d   Gay rights groups hailed Bloomberg\u2019s action.   \u201cThousands of New York City families will benefit because the funds will begin to treat our families as equal,\u201d Alan Van Capelle, executive director of the Empire State Pride Agenda, said.   The city\u2019s five pension boards \u2013 representing municipal workers, teachers, cops, firefighters, and more \u2013 all have representatives of the mayor on the boards.   Bloomberg also said he would seek a change in state law that would allow the city pension systems to recognize domestic partnerships for the purpose of benefits. "
