    "2004 - 1781": " LOS ANGELES \u2013 A liberal political-action committee targeted Arnold Schwarzenegger in a radio ad yesterday that mocks him as good for nothing but memorable movie lines.  In the 60-second spot by the California Voter Project, a voice mimics Schwarzenegger\u2019s as he prepares for a press conference.  A handler asks the voice: \u201cWith the state\u2019s budget bleeding red ink, what is your plan to balance the budget?\u201d  \u201cSchwarzenegger\u201d replies, \u201cIf it bleeds, we can kill it!\u201d  The handler replies, \u201cMr. Schwarzenegger, that\u2019s from \u2018Predator.\u2019 Can someone get Maria Shriver in here?\u201d  Former Democratic Party staffer Philip Muller, who is spearheading the project, told The Post he wants Schwarzenegger to be more accountable.  \u201cI\u2019m personally offended [he thinks] he can get away without answering questions,\u201d he said.  Meanwhile, Schwarzenegger said in a radio interview he\u2019s hurt by attack ads.  \u201cI only play a machine, but I really am a human being,\u201d the \u201cTerminator\u201d star told radio host Sean Hannity.  Also yesterday, Schwarzenegger spelled out his positions on a variety of issues, bowing to weeks of criticism that his campaign has been all style and no substance.  He said he\u2019s in favor of:  * Legalizing marijuana for medicinal purposes.  * Abortion rights \u2013 but not \u201cpartial-birth\u201d abortions. He\u2019s also for parental notification for minors.  * An assault-weapons ban.  * Background checks on gun purchases.  He\u2019s against:  * Offshore drilling.  * Gay marriage.  * Driver\u2019s licenses for illegal immigrants.  Schwarzenegger in 1994 supported Proposition 187, which sought to deny many services to illegal immigrants. But he said yesterday that the issue was history because courts had largely voided the measure.  Schwarzenegger gave his opinions during a call to the Hannity show. ",
    "2004 - 1235": " The state Democratic Party yesterday endorsed gay marriage \u2013 ending its previously neutral stance on the controversial issue.  \u201cWe want to make sure that these folks can have the same treatment as everybody else,\u201d said state Assemblyman Herman \u201cDenny\u201d Farrell, chairman of the party. \u201cThis does not impose our will on churches, mosques and synagogues.\u201d  The Empire State Pride Agenda, a gay and lesbian civil rights organization, immediately hailed the Democrats\u2019 move.  \u201cCivil marriage is the primary way in which government grants hundreds and hundreds of benefits and protections to Americans and their families,\u201d said the group\u2019s executive director, Alan Van Capelle.  The state Democrats\u2019 resolution, adopted at the party\u2019s gathering in Buffalo, states that the party is committed to equal treatment and civil rights for all people. It says that gay couples don\u2019t have the same property, inheritance, immigration, or other legal protections that heterosexual couples have when they marry.  City Council Speaker Gifford Miller shepherded a law through the council that allows city-owned hospitals and other agencies to recognize gay marriages performed in other jurisdictions.  Mayor Bloomberg signed that bill into law last year.",

    "2004 - 2416": " The highest court in Massachusetts ruled yesterday that homosexual couples there can marry \u2013 and gay-rights advocates hope New York soon follows suit.  The Supreme Judicial Court ruled 4-3 in favor of seven same-sex couples who argued that denying them civil marriage licenses violated the state\u2019s constitution.  While holding off granting marriage licenses to the seven couples, the court gave the Massachusetts Legislature six months to develop a way gay couples can wed.  But President Bush vowed to block the ruling.  \u201cI will work with congressional leaders and others to do what is legally necessary to defend the sanctity of marriage,\u201d he said in London.  The landmark decision, which legal experts say goes beyond even a previous Vermont decision that led to civil unions in that state, sent shock waves through the nation.   Elated gay-rights activists predicted the Massachusetts decision will lead other states, including New York, to legalize same-sex marriages.  \u201cWe feel confident this will happen, the only question is when,\u201d said Alan Van Capelle, executive director of the Empire State Pride Agenda, New York\u2019s largest gay lobbying organization.  City and state government employees here are already covered by domestic-partner benefits.  State Sen. Thomas Duane (D-Manhattan), one of three openly gay members of the state Legislature, hailed the \u201chistoric\u201d ruling and urged New York to pass a gay-marriage law during the upcoming 2004 session. Gov. Pataki and legislative leaders have been cool to legalizing gay marriage in New York.  State Conservative Party Chairman Michael Long and the state Catholic Conference vowed to strongly fight all efforts to legalize gay marriages. \u201cI don\u2019t believe a society can survive if you throw out the notion of marriage being between one man and one woman,\u201d Long said.  City Council Speaker Gifford Miller, who has sponsored several gay-rights bills, including one that recognizes gay marriages and unions entered into in other jurisdictions, said he\u2019d be willing to go to Massachusetts and Albany to fight for gay rights.  \u201cWe, as a city, must recognize when others are taking the right steps, and I wish that New York will take that step forward and allow marriages here in New York, and I hope and believe that someday we will,\u201d Miller said.  No American court has ordered the issuance of a marriage license \u2013 a privilege reserved for heterosexual couples.",

    "2004 - 1116": " WASHINGTON \u2013 Dick Gephardt and John Kerry ganged up on Howard Dean in last night\u2019s debate in Iowa, accusing Dean of cutting Medicaid and other services for the needy during Vermont\u2019s budget crunch.  \u201cYou don\u2019t just cut the most vulnerable in our society,\u201d Gephardt, a Missouri congressman, told Dean at the MSNBC-sponsored debate.  \u201cAs governor, you\u2019ve got to make tough decisions,\u201d Dean added, although he denied anyone in Vermont ever lost Medicaid coverage.  Kerry dodged a question about whether the Massachusetts legislature should quickly enact a law allowing gays to marry, now that the state Supreme Court ruled they should be allowed to do so.  Kerry, referring strictly to the legal rights of gay couples, said, \u201cI think the term \u2018marriage\u2019 gets in the way of what\u2019s really being talked about here.\u201d  Former Gen. Wesley Clark repeatedly criticized President Bush for failing to capture Osama bin Laden. \u201cI think the American people deserve to know what happened . . . We know we\u2019re not safer today,\u201d Clark said .  Kerry, accusing Bush of lying about Iraq, stated flatly, \u201cHe built a fraudulent coalition.\u201d",
    "2004 - 1832": "Drag queen Harvey Fierstein was sadly mistaken if he thought he could ride with Santa dressed as Mrs. Claus in the Thanksgiving Day Parade, organizers said yesterday.  The Broadway star caused a ruckus when he bragged he would portray Santa\u2019s better half in the 77th annual parade, which went off yesterday with beautiful weather and packed crowds.  But organizers insisted Fierstein was stepping all over a sacred tradition, not just because he was imposing his political views on a family event but because nobody \u2013 <em>nobody</em> \u2013 gets to ride with Santa as he brings up the rear of the parade.  \u201cHarvey Fierstein was invited to be [\u201cHairspray\u201d character] Edna Turnblad. He was always going to be riding on the Percy and the P-Birds float,\u201d insisted Elina Kazan, a spokeswoman for the parade organizer.  \u201cNobody else is on Santa\u2019s float. Mrs. Claus is either on the float or beside the float walking along with the elves.\u201d  The actor wrote in Wednesday\u2019s New York Times that he would portray Mrs. Claus and used it as jumping-off point for a discussion of gay marriage.  But organizers maintained he was scheduled to portray his \u201cHairspray\u201d character, Edna, dressed as Mrs. Claus, and was always relegated to a float with penguins and singing elves.  Santa scandal aside, the parade was under heavy NYPD security, and no problems were reported other than one clown hospitalized with a seizure.  Barney, Super Grover and Garfield balloons debuted this year, and were joined by old favorites Big Bird, Ronald McDonald, Pikachu, Mr. Monopoly and the show-stealing Jimmy Neutron, as well as balloons from the parade\u2019s early days, like a turkey from 1929.  \u201cIt\u2019s like a mini-vacation,\u201d said Higgins Hyacinthe, 37. \u201cThe streets are filled with fantasy and good-people traffic instead of the hustle.\u201d <em> With Post Wire Services</em>",
    "2004 - 1584": "President Bush finally came out last night to say he\u2019d back a constitutional ban on gay marriages.  While Bush has already said he would support whatever is \u201clegally necessary to defend the sanctity of marriage,\u201d he never took the ultimate step and address a possible constitutional ban \u2013 until now.  Apparently prodded by a recent Massachusetts court ruling striking down the state\u2019s ban on same-sex unions, the president said such a move means \u201cwe may need a constitutional amendment.\u201d Constitutional amendments supercede state law.  \u201cIf necessary, I will support a constitutional amendment which would honor marriage between a man and a woman, codify that,\u201d Bush told Diane Sawyer of ABC News.  \u201cThe position of this administration is that whatever legal arrangements people want to make, they\u2019re allowed to make, so long as it\u2019s embraced by the state or at the state level.\u201d  But gay-rights activist Winnie Stachelberg lashed back: \u201cIt is never necessary to insert prejudice and discrimination into the U.S. Constitution.\u201d  Even conservatives were wary about some of Bush\u2019s remarks.  \u201cWhile I\u2019m encouraged President Bush says he supports a constitutional amendment . . ., I\u2019m very concerned about his [statements] which seem to suggest the definition of marriage . . . can be redefined at the state level\u201d until a constitutional amendment is enacted, said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council.  During the same interview, Laura Bush also talked about how the couple\u2019s twin daughters have yet to find serious loves.<em>Additional reporting by Brian Blomquist</em>"
