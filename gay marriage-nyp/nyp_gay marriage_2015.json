    "2015 - 6252": "Cynthia and Robert Gifford are caught in a same-sex nightmare. They\u2019ve been forced to defend themselves against claims that they\u2019re lesbian-hating homophobes.\u201cWe respect and care for everyone!\u2019\u2019 Cynthia Gifford told me. \u201cWe had an openly gay man working for us this past season,\u2019\u2019 she said.\u201cWe\u2019ve had a woman who\u2019s transitioning to be a man. We don\u2019t discriminate against anyone.\u2019\u2019But the government of the state of New York sees things differently. The Giffords, who own the bucolic Liberty Ridge Farm in upstate New York, were ordered to pay a total of $13,000 \u2014 a $10,000 fine to the state and another $1,500 to each member of a lesbian couple to compensate them for \u201cmental anguish.\u2019\u2019 All because the Giffords, devout Christians, refused to hold a same-sex wedding ceremony on the property on which they live, work and have raised a daughter, 17, and a son, 21.\u201cThis is scary,\u2019\u2019 Cynthia Gifford said. \u201cIt\u2019s scary for all Americans.\u201d Fifteen years ago, Cynthia, 54, and Robert Gifford, 55, opened to the public their farm in upstate Schaghticoke, near Albany, where they\u2019ve lived for 25 years. They host an annual, family-friendly fall festival, which ends Tuesday, offering such countrified fare as a corn maze and pig-racing shows.In summer, wedding ceremonies and receptions also are held on the farm. But once already-booked nuptials take place, the Giffords will no longer schedule new ceremonies. Only receptions \u2014 including same-sex ones \u2014 will go on. What happened?Cynthia Gifford took a life-changing two- to three-minute phone call in 2012 from a woman she\u2019d never met, Melisa Erwin, who was looking for a place to hold her wedding. A wedding \u2014 to another woman.Gifford said she told her, politely, that she would not book a same-sex wedding ceremony at the farm.She didn\u2019t know it at the time, but the woman\u2019s then-fiance\u00e9, Jennifer McCarthy, recorded the conversation. The pair then filed a formal complaint with the state Division of Human Rights. And this past August, an administrative law judge from The Bronx, Migdalia Pares, decreed that the farm was a \u201cpublic accommodation\u2019\u2019 and ordered the penalties, after ruling that the Giffords had violated state law by discriminating against the two women.Incredible. The women, now both 31, currently live in upstate New York. They found another venue at which to get married, and each woman now uses the surname McCarthy. They declined my request for an interview.\u201cThey were devastated when they heard that Liberty Ridge Farm would not take their business because of who they are,\u2019\u2019 the ladies\u2019 lawyer, Mariko Hirose of the New York Civil Liberties Union, told me.\u201cNYCLU supports religious freedom,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cThat still doesn\u2019t make it OK for businesses to break existing law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, race, sex, disability, religion or other protected categories.\u2019\u2019\u201cWe\u2019ve gone from tolerance to compulsion,\u2019\u2019 the Giffords\u2019 lawyer, James Trainor, told me. \u201cState government should not be forcing people to violate their own religious beliefs, nor should they be forced to make a choice between making a living and violating their own faith.\u2019\u2019 Financial losses have forced the Giffords to let go a full-time event planner.\u201cI think there is an effort under way to change the social order,\u2019\u2019 said Trainor. \u201cOne way is by redefining marriage.\u2019\u2019Trainor is allied with Alliance Defending Freedom, an organization that seeks justice for people of faith. Last month, he filed an appeal with the state Appellate Division on behalf of the Giffords, seeking to get their money returned \u2014 and setting the stage for New York state\u2019s first legal battle pitting one couple\u2019s constitutional right to religious freedom against another couple\u2019s right to get married wherever they please.Readers know that I\u2019ve come to support same-sex marriage. But I can\u2019t understand why clergymen and -women are free in New York to opt out of joining in marriage homosexual couples, but the law gives not a lick of respect to non-ordained people of faith.In 2011, days before New York state\u2019s Marriage Equality Act legalized same-sex marriage statewide, I wrote about two New York state Refuseniks \u2014 town clerks who refused to unite Jills and Janes and Adams and Steves. One woman quit her job, another quit performing all weddings, due to their religiously held beliefs that marriage is the union of one man and one woman.Since then:Robert and Cynthia Gifford are decent people being punished for acting on their faith. This kind of government bigotry should appeal to no one, whether he or she (or one of no gender) identifies as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, androgynous . . . or even straight.City Comptroller Scott Stringer, Public Advocate Letitia James and City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito each have six-detective police security details assigned to them \u2014 made up of cops culled from the city Police Department\u2019s elite Intelligence Division.As The Post reported last week, four guys from Stringer\u2019s security team requested last month to be transferred from his side, and a fed-up female detective retired from the NYPD last summer. Stringer has ordered cops to drive around his wife, Elyse Buxbaum. And he chewed out two cops last month because they arrived late to transport her to work!Sources said Stringer follows rules that require him to be present when police are Driving Mrs. Stringer \u2014 by accompanying his wife on jaunts, even when he has no official business to conduct. What a waste of taxpayer money.What an insult to police officers.The speed limit on most local streets in New York City dropped from 30 mph to 25 on Friday as part of Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s Vision Zero initiative, which aims to end pedestrian traffic deaths.Your chances of surviving being hit by a vehicle traveling at 30 mph double if the fossil-fuel sucker has slowed to 25.Slow down, impatient New Yorkers. That means you, too, speed-demon taxi drivers.Four Islamic terrorists, believed by cops to have access to guns, planned to stab to death Queen Elizabeth II this weekend. The fiends\u2019 plot was foiled by British police. Yet the monarch, 88, refused to cancel Sunday\u2019s plans to publicly commemorate the 96th anniversary of the end of World War I. Go, queen!",

    "2015 - 3411": "Gov. Cuomo and legislative leaders have begun \u201cserious talks\u201d for a lame-duck session of the Legislature to hike the pay of New York\u2019s 213 lawmakers, as well as other state officials who haven\u2019t had a raise in 15 years, The Post has learned.The talks, involving senior staff, have only dealt so far with the \u201coutlines of a pay-raise agreement\u201d and have not reached the point of discussing how much legislative salaries, which start at $79,500 a year, should be increased, sources said.A widely accepted figure for a new legislative pay scale, however, is \u201cin excess\u201d of the $112,500-a-year base salary paid members of the New York City Council.Cuomo and legislative leaders planned to discuss the salary hikes last week, but the talks never occurred because of the deadly snowstorm that engulfed Western New York and drew the governor\u2019s presence.\u201cSerious talks on a pay raise are under way. It\u2019s staff so far. The governor was away in Buffalo,\u2019\u2019 said a senior official with knowledge of the situation.The state Constitution bars lawmakers from raising their salaries during their two-year terms, so a pay raise must be approved before the end of the year to cover the new Legislature that takes office in January.While Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver (D-Manhattan) and Senate Republican Leader Dean Skelos (R-Nassau) have strongly endorsed a pay hike, Cuomo \u2014 at least publicly \u2014 has not.The governor, who has repeatedly said that relatively low salaries have prevented him from recruiting top-flight talent to work in state government, was described by an administration insider as \u201cfearful\u2019\u2019 of a strong public backlash if he supports higher pay for the Legislature.\u201cThe Legislature is scandal-scarred and generally hated by the public, and the governor isn\u2019t sure how he can back a pay raise for them and not be damaged in the process,\u2019\u2019 said the source.Also weighing on Cuomo is a small but growing number of newspaper editorials opposing a pay hike.The latest came from the normally Cuomo-friendly Buffalo News, which headlined an editorial on Friday, \u201cGreedy state legislators should give up the idea of voting themselves a pay raise.\u2019\u2019Said a longtime Cuomo associate, \u201cCuomo isn\u2019t comfortable with tough decisions unless he has some cover from prominent newspapers, as he did from The New York Times with gay marriage and the SAFE Act on gun control.\u201cUnless he can get something similar, strong backing from respectable quarters, regarding a legislative pay raise, I don\u2019t see him doing it,\u2019\u2019 the associate continued.Gov. George Pataki approved a pay hike for lawmakers in 1998 in exchange for legalizing charter schools, an effort at budget reform and salary hikes for himself and other executive branch officials.What if any sorts of reforms Cuomo would attempt to extract from lawmakers in exchange for a pay hike remains unclear, although advocacy groups have called for linking pay raises to ending the widely abused system of \u201cper diem\u201d expense reimbursements for lawmakers and a higher minimum wage.New York lawmakers are the third-highest paid in the nation, trailing only members of the California ($90,526) and Pennsylvania ($84,012) state houses in base annual pay, according to data compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures.But Empire State pols are No. 1 among states that allow lawmakers to make money in jobs separate from Albany, topping closest rival Illinois ($67,836).",
    "2015 - 3549": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s shoo-in status as the Democratic candidate for president was badly damaged by US Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s forceful crusade to block a Wall Street-friendly provision from being included in the new $1.1 trillion federal spending bill, key Democrats have told The Post.Clinton, who has yet to weigh in on what for many \u201cprogressive\u2019\u2019 Democrats is fast becoming a defining issue \u2014 lifting a Dodd-Frank law provision that kept taxpayers from insuring riskier derivatives-trading activities \u2014 is going to have to do so, and do so soon, the Democrats agree.\u201cThis Warren thing puts Hillary in a horrendous position .\u2009.\u2009. and she\u2019s going to try to avoid it like the plague,\u2019\u2019 said a prominent New York Democratic consultant involved in presidential politics.\u201cWall Street money has always been Hillary\u2019s bread and butter, and she\u2019s been counting on it for 2016.\u201cNow, because of the Senate debate, she\u2019ll be forced to say where she stands on things like the derivatives rule and Wall Street\u2019s continuing effort to repeal Dodd-Frank.\u201cIt\u2019s a lose-lose proposition for her \u2014 either she loses Wall Street\u2019s financial backing or she alienates the entire [progressive] Democratic base,\u2019\u2019 continued the consultant, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s debates like these that make it harder and harder for Hillary to run for president in today\u2019s climate.\u2019\u2019Clinton, the former first lady, secretary of state and New York senator, has, like her ex-president husband, Bill, had ties to Wall Street bankers and institutions. She has been widely criticized, for instance, for accepting a reported $400,000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs last year.Warren\u2019s high-profile budget move failed late Saturday, but dramatically raised her standing among the Democrats\u2019 left-of-center party base. It couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time for Clinton.MoveOn.org is gearing up to spend $1 million on an effort to \u201cdraft\u2019\u2019 Warren into the 2016 presidential race and, just a few days ago, more than 300 of President Obama\u2019s former campaign staffers and organizers released a letter urging Warren to run.\u201cI didn\u2019t used to think that Warren would be a threat to Hillary, but I have to say, given the events of the last several days, I\u2019m starting to worry that she really is,\u2019\u2019 added another prominent Democrat.Rep. Chris Gibson of Kinderhook, who won re-election by a crushing 30 percentage points over Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes\u2019 husband, despite being outspent by nearly 3-to-1, is moving to rebuild the state\u2019s sclerotic Republican Party \u2014 and appears to be eyeing the race for governor in 2018.\u201cWe have to have a party that can compete in this state, that can get into the marketplace of ideas with candidates of vision and integrity, and that has the ability to rally people,\u2019\u2019 Gibson, a forceful, 50-year-old Gulf War veteran and Cornell Ph.D., told The Post.Gibson is a self-described fiscal conservative and gun-rights backer who also favors abortion rights and, while it takes him five minutes of abstract explaining to say, appears to back gay marriage.He argues that his lopsided victory over Sean Eldridge in a district that backed Obama two years ago could be a model for future Republican races statewide.\u201cWhat my race shows is that Republicans, through competence and ability, can bring people together, can rise above the traditional partisan divide,\u2019\u2019 Gibson said.He added that Mayor Bill de\u2009Blasio\u2019s left-of-center policies, along with Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s recent lurch to the left, give Republicans a strong opportunity to gain ground in the heavily Democratic state.",

    "2015 - 4178": "VATICAN CITY \u2014 Pope Francis named 15 new cardinals Sunday, selecting them from 14 nations including far-flung corners of the world such as Tonga, New Zealand, Cape Verde and Myanmar to reflect the diversity of the church and its growth in places like Asia and Africa compared to affluent regions.Other cardinals hail from Ethiopia, Thailand and Vietnam.None came from the United States and only three European nations received new cardinals \u2014 Portugal and Spain in addition to Italy. Cape Verde, Tonga and Myanmar gained cardinals for the first time.Francis told faithful in St. Peter\u2019s Square that the new batch of cardinals \u201cshows the inseparable tie with the church of Rome to churches in the world.\u201dFive new cardinals come from Europe, three from Asia, three from Latin America, including Mexico, and two each come from Africa and Oceania.With his picks, the Argentine-born Francis, the first pontiff from Latin America, made ever clearer that he is laying out a new vision of the church\u2019s identity, including of its hierarchy. He looked beyond traditional metropolitan area for the \u201cprinces of the church\u201d who will help advise him as goes forward with church reforms. Cardinals also elect his successor.He has said repeatedly that the church must reach out to those on the margins.The Vatican\u2019s chief spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said the selection \u201cconfirms that the pope doesn\u2019t feel tied to the traditional \u2018cardinal sees,\u2019 which reflected historic reasons in various countries.\u201d\u201cInstead we have various nominations of archbishops or bishops of sees in the past that wouldn\u2019t have had a cardinal,\u201d Lombardi said.The pontiff ignored another tradition: limiting to 120 the number of cardinals under 80 and eligible to vote for his successor.Counting the new cardinals, 125 cardinals will eligible to vote, although Lombardi noted, \u201che kept very close to it (120), so it was substantially respected.\u201dThe two nations with the biggest number of eligible electors are Italy, with 26, and the United States with 11.Notable among Pope Francis\u2019 picks are churchmen whose advocacy styles seem to particularly capture matters dear to his heart.Monsignor Francesco Montenegro, a Sicilian, was at his side when Francis made his first trip a few months into his papacy. Montenegro welcomed the pontiff to Lampedusa, a tiny Sicilian island whose people have helped thousands of migrants stranded by smugglers. The pontiff has repeatedly denounced human trafficking and urged more attention to people on the margins of society. He also has thundered against Mafiosi, and Montenegro\u2019s Agrigento diocese includes towns where people have dared to rebel against Cosa Nostra.The only native English-language speaker chosen by Francis is Archbishop John Atcherley Dew of Wellington, New Zealand. Summing up his own intervention at last year\u2019s Vatican conference on controversial family issues, including gay marriage and divorced Catholics, Dew has said the church must change its language to give \u201chope and encouragement.\u201dThe archdiocese of Morelia, Mexico, has its first cardinal: Alberto Suarez Inda. The archbishop, who turns 76 this month, has helped mediate political conflicts and kidnappings in one of Mexico\u2019s most violence-plagued states.Francis also bestowed the honor on five churchmen older than 80, including men from the pope\u2019s native Argentina, Mozambique and Colombia.Speaking from a Vatican window to a crowd in St. Peter\u2019s Square, Francis made another surprise announcement.

    "2015 - 1900": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Setting the stage for a potentially historic ruling, the Supreme Court says it will decide whether same-sex couples nationwide have a right to marry under the Constitution.The justices said Friday they will review an appellate ruling that upheld bans on same-sex unions in four states.The case will be argued in April and a decision is expected by late June.Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee are among the 14 states where gay and lesbian couples are not allowed to marry.The number of states that permit same-sex marriage has nearly doubled in three months as a result of federal and state court rulings.The justices\u2019 decision last October to turn away same-sex marriage appeals allowed some of those rulings to take effect. Florida last week became the 36th state to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.The court is extending the time it usually allots for argument from an hour to two-and-a-half hours. The justices will consider two related questions.The first is whether the Constitution requires states to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The other is whether states must recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere.The appeals before the court come from gay and lesbian plaintiffs in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee. The federal appeals court that oversees those four states upheld their same-sex marriage bans in November, reversing pro-gay rights rulings of federal judges in all four states.Ten other states also prohibit such unions. In Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, South Dakota and Texas, judges have struck down anti-gay marriage laws, but they remain in effect pending appeals.In Missouri, same-sex couples can marry in St. Louis and Kansas City only.Louisiana is the only other state that has seen its gay marriage ban upheld by a federal judge. There have been no rulings on lawsuits in Alabama, Georgia, Nebraska and North Dakota.",
