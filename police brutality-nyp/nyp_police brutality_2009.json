    "2009 - 1577": "  The brutal beating that R&amp;B singer Chris Brown unleashed on his pop-star girlfriend Rihanna grew so out of control that at one point he threatened to kill her.   \u201cYou are really f\u2014ed up now. I\u2019m going to kill you,\u201d the 19-year-old Brown allegedly screamed as he pummeled her, according to TMZ.com citing a police report.   The two had been arguing early Sunday morning as they drove in a rented Lamborghini from a pre-Grammy party thrown in Los Angeles by music mogul Clive Davis.   The screaming match grew so heated that Brown starting hitting Rihanna, 20, prompting her to order him to drive her home and then grab her cell phone on which she \u201cfaked a call.\u201d   \u201cHe\u2019s dropping me off. Make sure the cops are there,\u201d the report stated she said into the phone, sending Brown further into a rage.   As he beat her with his fists, she snatched the keys out of the ignition and threw them out the window.   The pop chanteuse was taken to the hospital with bruises to her face, a split lip, bloody nose and bite marks on her arm and fingers. He later turned himself into police and was released on $50,000 bail.   Rihanna told police that the incident was not the first in which he beat her and said they were involved in an escalating abusive relationship, TMZ reported.   Brown\u2019s cousin, Phylicia Thompson, leapt to the singer\u2019s defense, saying he \u201cwas not brought up\u00e2to beat on a woman.\u201d   \u201cIt had to be something to provoke him for Chris to do it,\u201d she told Extra. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have done is just to be having fun. But what happens behind closed doors, nobody ever knows.\u201d",
    "2009 - 2495": " An Afghan diplomat beat his wife with a belt and shoved her down a flight of stairs in their Queens home \u2013 then assaulted her again when she returned from filing a police complaint, prosecutors said yesterday.   Mohammed Fagirzad, 30, tried to invoke diplomatic immunity after twice brutalizing his wife Safah, 22, but cops found that he did not rate full immunity and could be arrested, sources said.   Officials said Fagirzad, vice consul at the Afghan consulate on Lexington Avenue, has immunity covering actions related to his duties \u2013 not off-duty assault.   \u201cThe defendant is accused of repeatedly and savagely beating his wife over a prolonged period,\u201d said Queens DA Richard Brown. \u201cSuch conduct has no place in a civilized society.\u201d   After he was released on his own recognizance at a hearing last night \u2013 his wife, who broke down in tears in court \u2013 tried to take the blame.   \u201cI am the problem, not him,\u201d she told The Post. \u201cThis is not his fault.\u201d   Police and prosecutors believe otherwise, and say Safah suffered a 15-hour ordeal that began Wednesday morning when the couple quarreled in their home on 26th Avenue in Flushing.   He allegedly grabbed her neck and pinned her against a wall, then dropped her to the floor, grabbed her arm and slapped her repeatedly, prosecutors said.   He allegedly hit her with a belt while calling her a dog and saying he was going to treat her like one. Before storming out, he flung her down a stairway, authorities said.   After he left, Safah filed a domestic-violence report at the 109th Precinct and returned home.   Sometime later her husband also returned, authorities said, and resumed his campaign of terror, tossing her to the floor, sitting on her chest and squeezing her neck for three to four minutes attacked her again.   He then took her cellphone and called the cops \u2013 to report that <em>she</em> had attacked <em>him</em>, sources said.   The responding officers, alerted to the report filed by Safah, took them to the station house.   Once there, they summoned an ambulance for her and got in touch with the city\u2019s Commission for the United Nations, Consular Corps and Protocol to see whether they could arrest him. They were told they could.   Fagirzad was ordered at last night\u2019s hearing to say away from his wife. He declined comment as he left court.   Officials at the Afghan Consulate in New York and at the Afghan Embassy in Washington refused comment. <em>Additional reporting by Jennifer Fermino and Murray Weiss</em>",
    "2009 - 1974": "  A massive ape lost control at his Connecticut owner\u2019s home today and mauled a woman\u2019s face before he was repeatedly stabbed by his horrified owner and eventually shot dead by police, authorities said.  Travis, a 200-pound primate, attacked the 55-year-old woman today in Stamford as she visited her friend and chimp owner Sandy Herold around 3:30 p.m, cops said.  When Herold saw what happening, she ran out of the house with a butcher knife and stabbed Travis numerous times.  Cops showed up and a bloodied Travis tried to open a door of the patrol car. When he discovered it was locked, he moved to the other side and ripped the mirror off.  One of the officers then shot Travis.   The 15-year-old chimp staggered back inside Herald\u2019s home, where he collapsed in a pool of blood.   The victim was taken to Stamford Hospital with severe facial injuries.   \u201cIt was a very brutal attack,\u201d said Stamford police Cpt. Richard Conklin, adding that the woman\u2019s \u201chands were mangled.\u201d  In 2003, Travis escaped from the Herold car by jumping from her car in Stamford. He was corralled by cops a few hours later.  Travis was well known around Stamford because he rode around in the truck belonging to Herold\u2019s towing company, Desire Me Motors in Stamford, according to the Stamford Advocate newspaper.   Also in the 2003 escape incident, a man threw something in Herold\u2019s truck that struck Travis. The chimp unbuckled his seatbelt, opened the door and ran out after the man, but did not catch him, the paper said.   Later that day, Travis then played at an intersection for two hours, causing traffic to stall. Police eventually sedated him with stun guns and got him back into the truck.  Travis took his own bath, ate at the table and drank wine from a stemmed glass. He also brushed his teeth using a Water Pik, according to the Stamford Advocate.   Aside from appearing in Coca Cola and Old Navy TV commercials, he appeared once on the \u201cMaury Povich Show\u201d and was in a TV pilot.",
    "2009 - 4342": "  A massive chimp who loved flowers, filet mignon and the Yankees went berserk outside his Connecticut home yesterday, mauling his owner\u2019s friend before being killed by cops.   Capt. Richard Conklin of the Stamford police said officers had no choice but to open fire on Travis, a 200-pound chimpanzee, after he cornered a cop in a cruiser at around 3:30 p.m.   Police aren\u2019t sure what triggered Travis\u2019 wild-in-the-jungle rampage, though Conklin said the ape had been acting odd in 70-year-old owner Sandra Herold\u2019s home, and neighbors claim he suffered from Lyme disease.   He said she gave him Xanax in tea to quiet him, but the chimp grabbed the keys to open the kitchen door, went outside and started banging on car doors to indicate he wanted to go for a ride.   \u201cHe\u2019s a very clever chimp,\u201d Conklin said.   Meanwhile, Herold called family friend Charla Nash, 55, to help round up the bonkers chimp.   \u201cJust as Nash arrived at the house and exited her vehicle, the chimp went up to her, jumped on her and began biting and mauling her,\u201d Conklin said.   \u201cThis is unprecedented with this chimpanzee,\u201d he added, noting Travis had lived with Herold and her late husband for nearly 13 of his 16 years.   A frantic Herold wrestled with Travis, then called 911. Herold suffered minor wounds in the struggle.   \u201cShe retrieved a large butcher knife and stabbed her longtime pet numerous times in an effort to save her friend, who was really being brutally attacked,\u201d Conklin said.   After mauling Nash, who was \u201cvery seriously injured,\u201d Travis roamed the property as cops swarmed in.   The wounded Travis zeroed in on one cruiser, running to one side and trying to open a locked door. He quickly scooted to the other side, ripping off a side mirror while opening another door.   The trapped cop inside shot Travis several times in self-defense. The mortally wounded ape then staggered back into his house.   \u201cThey followed the blood trail in the house, and he was in his cage, dead,\u201d Conklin said.   Mayor Dannel Malloy of Stamford said the bizarre attack was not unexpected.   \u201cWild animals are wild animals,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the power of these animals . . . We should never forget that.\u201d   Conklin speculated Nash, who had visited before, may have confused the chimp by wearing her hair in a different style. \u201cToday the friend had her hair up,\u201d he said.   Don Mecca, a friend of Herold and her late husband, said he was stunned, noting that Travis was normally \u201cso well behaved.\u201d   The chimp liked watering flowers, wine, expensive steak, brushing his teeth and even watching baseball games on TV. Neighbors also said he liked to pretend to drive his owners\u2019 cars \u2013 including a pink Cadillac convertible.   Travis also fed hay to the horses near his house in a rural part of Stamford.   He briefly rooted for the Mets when Stamford native Bobby Valentine was the manager, but later changed his allegiance to the Yankees, his owner said.   \u201cHe loves baseball. He likes anything with action,\u201d Herold said in a 2003 interview.   He also dressed himself and could log onto a computer, she said.   \u201cIf I cry, he\u2019ll lick my tears,\u201d Herold said.   Neighbor Tom Kennedy said Herold treated the chimp like gold.   \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone take such good care of an animal,\u201d he said. \u201cShe loved him.\u201d   Despite being domesticated, Travis had a wild side.   In October 2003, he bolted from his owners\u2019 SUV and occupied an intersection in the heart of Stamford, holding police at bay for a few hours.   Cops arrived with more than a dozen cruisers but had difficulty catching the diaper-wearing chimp, who continued playing in the street and occasionally charged officers. No one was hurt.   Travis was somewhat of celebrity during his younger days. He did TV commercials for Coca-Cola and Old Navy and even appeared on \u201cThe Maury Povich Show.\u201d   Conklin said that the laws for owning chimps are stringent and had been \u201ctightened up\u201d locally in recent years, but that the Herolds were \u201cgrandfathered\u201d in and legally owned Travis.   Prior to the 2003 incident, Travis had been well known around Stamford because he rode around in the truck belonging to Herold\u2019s towing company, Desire Me Motors in Stamford, and would wave to passers-by. <em>Additional reporting by Doug Healy</em><em><a href=\"mailto:rich.calder@nypost.com\">rich.calder@nypost.com</a></em>",
    "2009 - 3359": "  The Connecticut woman viciously attacked by a 200-pound chimp who inexplicably went bananas remains in critical condition this afternoon and faces \u201clife-changing, if not life-threatening injuries\u201d to her face and hands, officials said.  The chimpanzee, named Travis, was shot dead by police in Stamford after the violent rampage Monday left a friend of its owner badly mauled.  Sandra Herold, who owned the 15-year-old chimp, wrestled with the animal after it attacked her friend, Charla Nash, 55.   Nash had gone to Herold\u2019s home to help her coax the chimp back into the house after he got out, authorities said.  After the animal \u2013 who had appeared in TV commercials for Old Navy and Coca-Cola when he was younger \u2013 lunged at Nash when she got out of her car, Herold ran inside to call 911 and returned armed with a knife and shovel.  Nash remains in critical condition after suffering what Stamford Mayor Dannel Malloy called this morning \u201clife-changing, if not life-threatening\u201d injuries to her face and hands.  Her sister-in-law, Kate Nash, said that Nash underwent surgery Monday night and came out of it \u201cOK.\u201d  \u201cIt was a very brutal attack,\u201d said Stamford police Cpt. Richard Conklin, adding that the woman\u2019s \u201chands were mangled.\u201d  Conklin said the chimp was in a frenzy earlier in the day and that Herold had given him the anti-anxiety drug Xanax in some tea.  He also said the animal may have attacked Nash because she was wearing her hair differently and had failed to recognize her.  \u201cThere was no provocation that we know of,\u201d said Conklin. \u201cOne thing that we\u2019re looking into is that we understand the chimpanzee has Lyme disease and has been ill from that, so maybe from the medications he was out of sorts. We really don\u2019t know.\u201d  After the 3:30 p.m. attack, Travis ran away and started roaming Herold\u2019s property until police arrived \u2013 setting up security so medics could reach the critically injured woman.  But the chimpanzee returned and went after several of the officers, who retreated into their cars.   Travis knocked the mirror off a cruiser before opening its door and starting to get in, trapping the cop.  That officer shot the chimpanzee several times.  \u201cThe animal had cornered him,\u201d Conklin said. \u201cHe had no other recourse.\u201d  The wounded chimpanzee fled the scene, but Conklin said police were able to follow the trail of his blood down a driveway, into the open door of the home, through the house and to his living quarters, where he died of his wounds.  Herold and two officers also suffered minor injuries.  Cops had dealt with the chimp in the past \u2013 including an incident in 2003 when he escaped from his owners\u2019 car in downtown Stamford for two hours.  At the time, officers used cookies, macadamia nuts and ice cream in an attempt to lure him, but subdued him only after he became too tired to resist.  At the time of the 2003 incident, police said the Herold assured them that the chimpanzee \u2013 who was toilet trained, dressed himself, took his own bath, ate at the table and drank wine from a glass \u2013 was not a threat to others.  Colleen McCann, a primatologist at the Bronx Zoo, said chimps are unpredictable and dangerous even after living among humans for years.   \u201cThey are unpredictable, and in instances like this you cannot control that behavior or prevent it from happening if it is in a private home,\u201d she said.",
    "2009 - 1029": "  Cops are hoping to get the last laugh in the case of a brutal hate crime.   Here is a chilling video released today of a Bronx man giggling to his heart\u2019s content just 19 minutes after he allegedly beat a man to death with a baseball bat.  Keith Phoenix, 28, was all smiles as he pulled into an cash lane as he drove past a Robert F. Kennedy Bridge toll window on Dec. 7 after he beat Ecuadorian immigrant Jose Sucuzhanay to death on a Brooklyn street, police said.  Cops released the video as they continue to hunt for Phoenix.  Another suspect, Hakim Scott, 25, was busted on Tuesday and was awaiting arraignment this afternoon on charges of second-degree murder as a hate crime.  As the duo yelled anti-gay slurs, cops said Scott and Phoenix attacked Sucuzhanay, 31, mistakenly thinking the real estate agent was gay because he was walking arm-in-arm with his brother.  Police said Scott admitted he and Phoenix were driving through Brooklyn in an SUV that day \u2013 but denied they were looking to beat up on Hispanics or gays.",
    "2009 - 1659": "  A doorman sprang into action to save a woman from a thug who may be responsible for a string of baseball bat attacks on the Upper East Side, sources said yesterday.   Joel Afanador, 25, was standing outside a building on East 89th Street near York Avenue when he saw a thug rush up behind a 31-year-old woman, knock her into a pile of garbage bags and jump on her back at about 12:30 a.m. Tuesday.   \u201cShe couldn\u2019t yell because her face was pushed into the garbage,\u201d said Afanador.   He and another doorman scared away the assailant. Afanador chased after him but couldn\u2019t catch up.   Afanador said he knew something was amiss when he noticed a suspicious-looking man walking closely behind the woman and walked out of the vestibule of his building at East 89th Street near York Avenue   \u201cI just watched and followed him down the block until I saw him jump her from behind,\u201d he said.   Just five hours earlier, two other women, ages 42 and 25, were brutally attacked by a bat-wielding man in separate incidents.   In both cases, just minutes apart, he rushed up from behind and bashed them in the head on East 90th Street.   One was whacked on the left side of her head and had her purse snatched near York Avenue, while the other was attacked near First Avenue.   Cops believe the man is also responsible for the Feb. 22 Central Park attack on a 46-year-old woman, who was also hit in the head and robbed of $15,000 in jewelry while walking her dog at East Drive and 91st Street.   Police said the crimes were likely the work of a black man, approximately 5-foot-8 and 150 pounds.<em><a href=\"mailto:jamie.schram@nypost.com\">jamie.schram@nypost.com</a></em>",
    "2009 - 3349": "  R&amp;B singer Chris Brown faces two felonies for allegedly assaulting his songstress girlfriend Rihanna during a vicious fight last month, authorities said today.  Brown, 19, appeared in a Los Angeles courtroom today but his arraignment was postponed until next month. The charges against him include \u201cassault by means likely to cause bodily injury\u201d and making a \u201ccriminal threat,\u201d prosecutors said.  If convicted, Brown faces a possible sentence ranging from probation to four years and eight months behind bars, prosecutors said.<a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/seven/03052009/news/nationalnews/rihanna.pdf\"><strong>Read the Search Warrant Request (pdf)</strong></a><a class=\"legacy-link\"><strong>Read the Full Criminal Complaint Against Brown</strong></a><a class=\"legacy-link\"><strong>PHOTOS: Stars Who Stand By Their Man</strong></a><a class=\"legacy-link\"><strong>PAGE SIX: Secret of Chris Brown-Rihanna Pix</strong></a>  LA cops busted Brown for allegedly beating Rihanna, 21, on Feb. 8 following a pre-Grammy party.  The felony complaint identifies Brown\u2019s alleged victim only as \u201cRobyn F.\u201d Rihanna\u2019s real name is Robyn Fenty.  Brown is accused of repeatedly punching Rihanna to the point where she almost lost consciousness and blood splattered all over her clothes \u2013 then threatened to \u201ckill\u201d her once \u201cthey got home,\u201d according to a 11-page police report seeking a search warrant.  In reaction to the charges, Rihanna\u2019s dad, Ronald Fenty, told Us magazine\u2019s Web site that \u201cjustice can never be served in this situation. He can\u2019t feel the pain she felt.\u201d  He also called Brown \u201ca very talented guy\u201d \u2013 but still think he\u2019s \u201ca little immature for Rihanna.\u201d  Despite the brutal assault, the clean-cut singer has won back his battered gal pal after a weekend of fun and sun at P. Diddy\u2019s island home near Miami.  Brown was originally only booked for making a verbal threat \u2013 although a shocking LAPD crime photo showed Rihanna with a horrifically bruised and cut face.  According to LAPD, the fight broke out after Rihanna read a text message on her boyfriend\u2019s phone from a \u201cwoman who Brown had a previous sexual relationship with,\u201d according to the paperwork.  That\u2019s when an argument erupted and Brown allegedly tried to force Rihanna out of the car, but couldn\u2019t because she was wearing her seat belt.  The warrant shows that Brown then shoved Rihanna\u2019s head against the passenger window.  When Rihanna turned to face him, Brown punched several times in the face and mouth as while driving, according to the report.  As a result, blood spattered all over Rihanna\u2019s clothing and on the car\u2019s upholstery.  That\u2019s when Brown allegedly told Rihanna, \u201cI\u2019m going to beat the sh- out of you when we get home. You wait and see.\u201d  Rihanna frantically called her assistant and left a message saying, \u201cI am on my way home. Make sure the cops are there when I get there.\u201d  Brown then barked, \u201cYou just did the stupidest thing ever. I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d  He then threw Rihanna\u2019s phone out the car window.  According to the report, Brown continued to punch Rihanna, bit her on the ear, her fingers and put her in a headlock to the point when she almost lost consciousness.  A message left for Brown\u2019s lawyer Mark Geragos was not immediately returned.  Brown\u2019s publicist Tony Knight said any statement would likely come from Geragos after the hearing."
