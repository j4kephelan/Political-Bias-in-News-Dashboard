    "2016 - 18567": "<em>Jan. 1 marked a significant cultural shift in China \u2014 starting this year, families will be able to have two children.

It showed what kind of contraceptives they used; whether they had one or two children; if they were sterilized, pregnant, married or single.This took the saying, \u201cKnow thy neighbor,\u201d to a new level.Green Chrysanthemum was a cheery 45-year-old woman who ran the snack shop in a tiny village called Huangjiapu, Yicheng County. Until recently, she also earned an extra $60 a year as a \u201ccluster leader,\u201d keeping track of 10 households\u2019 reproductive habits and reporting these details to the village\u2019s family-planning commission.\u201cIt\u2019s not a difficult job. Everybody knows each other so well,\u201d she said. Not one person in her group exceeded the two-child limit, she proudly told me.In addition to cluster leaders like Green Chrysanthemum, Huangjiapu, population 500, had 15 full-timers tasked with family-planning matters.<img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright wp-image-10044841\" height=\"453\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"https://vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/01/onechild_cover.jpg?quality=100\" srcset=\"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/01/onechild_cover.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=600 600w, https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/01/onechild_cover.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=450 450w, https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/01/onechild_cover.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=300 300w, https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/01/onechild_cover.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=150 150w, https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/01/onechild_cover.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all 1000w\" width=\"300\"/> These village-level offices are the most basic building blocks of China\u2019s birth-planning machinery, a bloated behemoth that goes from some 85 million part-time employees at the grass-roots level all the way up to half a million full-time employees at the National Population and Family Planning Commission.The commission also has its own archives and statistics and propaganda departments; affiliate centers for pharmacological research, film production and publishing; and a consulting company that handles exhibitions and conferences.Other state organizations such as the military and police have their own internal family-planning units, as do state-owned companies.The complexity of this machinery and its reach are partly why Beijing took its time winding down the one-child policy, say analysts.Birth planning had been so baked into the business of ordinary governance, its revenue contributions so necessary, that unwinding all this posed a challenge.I went to Yicheng to understand how such a vast machine worked at the basic level. Given the county\u2019s more liberal birth quotas, I was able to get some retired family-planning officials to speak on the record.Many officials had been doing the work since before the onset of the one-child policy in 1980, continuing through the introduction of Yicheng\u2019s special two-child status in 1985. They were able to explain to me the vacillations of the policy, which they themselves found dizzying.Green Chrysanthemum, for example, explained that family planning work was practically unnecessary nowadays, since younger members in her group didn\u2019t even want a second child because of the expense.\u201cEverybody wants just one,\u201d she said. Since 1985, only one family in Huangjiapu has had a third child, she said, a relatively wealthy couple with an auto parts business.In one year alone, 1983, China sterilized over 20 million people, more than the combined population of the three largest US cities, New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.But even with a looser two-child limit there were still rules people found onerous, such as a requirement throughout the 1990s that women be sterilized after the birth of a second child, or a requirement that births must be spaced at least five years apart.What if a woman didn\u2019t want more children but would prefer not to be sterilized? What if a couple got pregnant with their second child, say, three years after the first, instead of five? That was when even Yicheng\u2019s benign machinery would show its ugly side, according to Huangjiapu\u2019s former village head Huang Denggao.The usual mode of punishment was fines: Parents of children born out of plan would be hit with fines between five and 10 times their annual disposable income. \u201cIf the couple is too poor to pay, we\u2019ll take things from their house, but only in a few cases,\u201d said Huang.TVs were a favorite, he said \u2014 worth a villager\u2019s whole annual income \u2014 as were tables, bicycles and washing machines. These items were usually collected by a team of 10 part-time enforcers (usually \u201cstrong healthy young men\u201d) and sold off, and the proceeds were kept by the township.To Huang, these actions did not count as coercion. Rather, he called such tactics \u201cpersuasion.\u201dOne of the most difficult tasks Huang had to do was persuade women to be sterilized, he said. Many women feared the procedure. Side effects such as excessive bleeding were not uncommon, especially given the conveyor-belt manner in which some of these procedures were done. The village women tried to bargain, said Huang. Some asked to use barrier contraceptives instead, or promised not to have more than two children.\u201cBut it was my job to get people to do the operation, or else I would not be able to accomplish my target,\u201d said Huang. \u201cI can\u2019t possibly guarantee they won\u2019t have another baby with just a promise.\u201dIn one year alone, 1983, China sterilized over 20 million people, more than the combined population of the three largest US cities, New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.When the one-child policy was launched in the 1980s, it was clear that enforcement of such a hugely unpopular policy would be difficult.In the beginning, execution of the one-child policy ranged from lax to excessive across China. In some parts of the country, pregnant women without birth permits were marched off in handcuffs to undergo forced abortions. In others, officials ignored or paid mere lip service to these strictures from the central government.It didn\u2019t help that other national regulations undercut the one-child policy\u2019s intentions. A new marriage law, also launched in 1980, lowered the legal age of marriage to 20 for women and 22 for men. This was done to combat illegal marriage and sex crimes, but of course it also encouraged more unions and, by extension, babies.The move toward agricultural decollectivization also undermined official efforts to enforce the one-child policy. Under collectivism, pay, rations and other benefits were meted out by village leaders, and bad behavior (having an out-of-plan child, for instance) could be punished directly; new reforms loosened official control over peasants\u2019 livelihoods.By 1984, the nationwide one-size-fits-all measure proved so unpopular that the central government was forced to decentralize a large portion of the one-child policy. It circulated new provisions enshrined in what population scholars call Document 7.Document 7 gave each province more power to adapt the one-child policy to local circumstances. This was the beginning of a raft of exclusions that made it hard for people within China \u2014 never mind outside China \u2014 to understand the policy in anything but the broadest strokes, because conditions really were different from place to place.For example, residents in many rural areas were allowed to have a second child, provided their first was not a son \u2014 a tacit acknowledgment of the son hunger that was rampant in the countryside. Places like Tibet and Yunnan, with large ethnic minorities, had vastly more liberal policies than more populous provinces like Sichuan and Henan.Document 7 did not remedy the lack of transparency and accountability within the system. Local officials had wide discretion in determining how much to fine violators. Sums could range from a multiple of two to 10 times annual household income. People had no way of figuring out ahead of time what they were liable for, and two sets of violators, under similar circumstances, might pay vastly different penalties. In 2010, a family-planning official apparently imposed a fine of 5 million yuan, or over $800,000, on a violator.When that person protested, the official allegedly increased the fine, saying, \u201cYou are just a piece of meat on the chopping block,\u201d according to local media reports.In essence, the central government gave local provinces the message, \u201cMeet your birth quotas; we don\u2019t really care to know how.\u201dThey also expected provinces to fund the bulk of population planning on their own. This created a system ripe for corruption.Up until the early 2000s, at least, many international actors chose to believe that adherence to the one-child policy was voluntary, despite growing evidence to the contrary. In 1983, the first-ever United Nations Population Award medals, for individuals who had made \u201coutstanding contributions\u201d to solving population issues, were conferred on Indira Gandhi \u2014 she of the forced sterilizations \u2014 and China\u2019s minister of population planning, Qian Xinzhong.As awards go, it was akin to the Nobel Peace Prize committee giving Yasser Arafat the nod. It is still a source of embarrassment to the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), but it did not stop former head Nafis Sadik from accepting an award from the Chinese government in 2002. Dr. Sadik said she believed harsh enforcement of the one-child policy to be rare, thanks in large part to the UNFPA\u2019s collaboration with Beijing. Because of the one-child policy, the US government seesawed between giving and withholding contributions to the UNFPA.Former UN and other nongovernmental officials I spoke to privately said they worked hard behind the scenes to get China\u2019s birth planners to move toward a more service-oriented system. When I spoke to them, Beijing appeared to be cautiously exploring these avenues, including a pilot project to turn enforcers into parenting counselors.But such efforts were still limited.<figure class=\"wp-caption alignright\" id=\"attachment_10044838\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10044838\" height=\"340\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px\" src=\"https://vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/01/onechild_author.jpg?quality=100&amp;strip=all&amp;w=300\" srcset=\"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/01/onechild_author.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=340 340w, https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/01/onechild_author.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=170 170w, https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/01/onechild_author.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all 450w\" width=\"340\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span>Mei Fong</span></figcaption></figure> Logic dictates that as long as the one-child system endured, and quotas and targets were imposed, coercion continued. As recently as 2010, a mass sterilization campaign for close to 10,000 people was held in Puning City, Guangdong. According to Amnesty International, almost 1,400 relatives of couples targeted for sterilization were detained, to pressure these couples to consent.I believe, however, that the nature of this abuse increasingly shifted away from forced abortions and sterilizations toward stiffer enforcement of fines. This was partly because these so-called social compensation fees ( shehui fuyangfei ) grew to become a major source of revenue for many counties, especially poorer ones. Over the past decade China implemented land tax reforms, requiring provinces to hand over income to the national treasury for redistribution. In practice, this meant that lower-level county and village governments lost almost all independent sources of income.The one exception was birth fines, which did not have to be handed over to the central government. \u201cIt\u2019s a common saying, for money, \u2018Big cities depend on land, small towns depend on birth planning,\u2019 \u201d said journalist Matthew Pang, who exhaustively documented such abuses by family-planning officials in a small town in Hunan.In 2013, lawyer Wu Youshui took advantage of a provision in Chinese law, similar to the US Freedom of Information Act, to request that each province account for how much it collected in social compensation fees. The total came to $2.7 billion, an amount that is almost certainly an underestimation, says Wu.The most memorable discussion I had on the workings of the population police came during a chance discussion with a man whom I\u2019ll call Uncle Li.Uncle Li was a relative of a friend, a businessman who\u2019d volunteered to give us a ride to a neighboring town. He\u2019d come to pick us up in his black Audi, a man in his late forties dressed in the uniform of moderately prosperous urban Chinese men \u2014 polo shirt, collar modishly flipped up, big clunky watch with many complicated dials, leather man-bag. I was just admiring how well kept his car was, with tiny pouches holding sunshades, tissue boxes, and mineral water, and little bow-shaped pillow headrests, when we started talking.It turned out that in 1994, Uncle Li\u2019s first job out of college was as a county-level administrator. He became quite chatty talking about it. Meeting population targets was part of his job, and the most important one because of yipiaofoujue, he said. \u201cIf they couldn\u2019t pay, then you would confiscate some things of value in the home, but they were never such expensive things because villagers were poor \u2014 just things like grain, or homespun cloth,\u201d he remembered. \u201cSometimes, we would climb up the roofs and make a hole, to show we meant business, or knock down some windows,\u201d he recounted. In his province, the one-child policy was taken very seriously, so fines were heavily punitive.We stopped for lunch, and he continued talking, quite cheerfully, about property damage, confiscations, and pay scales. I didn\u2019t want to interrupt the flow, but at the back of my mind I was dying to ask the big question: How could you bear to be so beastly every day?Finally, I ventured, \u201cDoing this job must be hard, since people don\u2019t want to do as you say.\u201dHe fell silent. Then he said, \u201cThere\u2019s this one incident I\u2019ll never forget.\u201cI was 24, and we had heard of a woman pregnant with an out-of-plan baby who had run away to a neighboring village. So we made preparations to catch her at night. I got together a team of six or seven people. We surrounded the house. We were very quiet, but I don\u2019t know, somehow she must have heard something \u2014 maybe voices \u2014 because she ran.\u201d\u201cHow many months was she?\u201d I asked.\u201cI don\u2019t know, but she looked pretty big. She ran and ran and ran until she came to a pond. Then she ran in, until the water was at her neck\u201d \u2014 his hand sliced his Adam\u2019s apple. \u201cShe stood there and began to cry.\u201dI was transfixed by the picture he\u2019d painted. The woman with her bellyful of child, keening in the dark, officials circling the water hole like predators.\u201cWhat happened?\u201dHe looked away. \u201cPlease, wait a moment,\u201d he said. The cheery insouciance was gone.\u201cShe said a lot of things. She said she needed to have this baby. She would never have any peace, and her husband and her mother-in-law would never treat her well, until she had a son.\u201dI felt we were doing wrong, but I had no choice.He lit a cigarette, clearing his throat.\u201cFinally, two women officials waded in and took her away.\u201dWe were silent.\u201cWhy did this one incident stay with you, when you must have had so many of these encounters?\u201d I asked.\u201cMaybe it was because I was young,\u201d he said, slowly. \u201cI felt we were doing wrong, but I had no choice.\u201dThat night, I was so moved by the story that I related it to a former student of mine whom I was meeting for drinks. She had grown up in the area and was now a PhD student in America. I thought the anecdote was powerful, but I figured she must have heard similar stories all her life.She listened, her eyes widening.\u201cBut you must have heard these stories before. What about your schoolmates? Surely some must have come from the countryside and told these stories?\u201d I asked in surprise.She knew, of course, the contours of the one-child policy. But the brutal vividness of this tale was something else. \u201cYou must understand,\u201d she said.\u201cI went to Renmin University. To get there I had to go to a top high school, and a top middle school, and those kinds of places are not easy for children from the countryside to get into. Most of my friends and classmates were like me, middle-class, children from the city.\u201dI was reminded yet again that despite the Internet and an increasingly globalized world, many Chinese people\u2019s perceptions of recent historical events can be sketchy.While writing her book on the 1989 student protests at Tiananmen, National Public Radio correspondent Louisa Lim visited four top Chinese universities and showed students a picture of \u201cTank Man,\u201d the iconic picture of a single person stopping an oncoming line of tanks. To the Western world, it is one of the most recognizable images of the event. Lim found that only 15 out of a 100 students recognized the photo.It struck me as ironic that people of my former student\u2019s generation would know so little about a policy that birthed them and will continue to shape their reality. Yet to my student, such a story was a tale from another country.<strong><em>Excerpted with permission from \u201c<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/054427539X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=054427539X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=nypost-20&amp;linkId=KOSKVDVEQDDDN2WY&amp;asc_refurl=https://nypost.com/2016/01/03/how-chinas-pregnancy-police-brutally-enforced-the-one-child-policy/&amp;asc_source=web\" target=\"_blank\">One Child: The Story of China\u2019s Most Radical Experiment</a> by Mei Fong.\u201d Out now from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.</em></strong>",

    "2016 - 7295": "FLORENCE, Italy \u2014 DNA analysis of a condom and cigarette butt led Italian prosecutors to arrest a Senegalese man in <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2016/01/10/american-woman-found-dead-in-italian-apartment/\">the death of an American woman</a> who suffered two fractures to her skull before being strangled in her Florence apartment, they said Thursday.The naked body of Ashley Olsen, 35, of Summer Haven, Florida, was discovered Saturday morning by her boyfriend.Florence chief prosecutor Giuseppe Creazzo told a news conference that investigators <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2016/01/14/suspect-in-killing-of-american-is-brother-to-top-club-promoter/\">had detained Tidiane Cheik Diaw, a 25-year-old Senegalese immigrant</a>, based on witness testimony and DNA analysis, and also because he had Olsen\u2019s cellphone.He said Diaw had offered \u201csubstantially admissive\u201d testimony in response to the accusations during a preliminary interrogation that lasted until 4 a.m. Thursday. Diaw has not yet been charged.Citing witness testimony and street cameras, Creazzo said Olsen and Diaw met for the first time at the Montecarla disco in Florence early Friday and went together to Olsen\u2019s apartment in the Tuscan city\u2019s historic center.He said they had consensual sex. Both <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2016/01/14/italian-police-make-arrest-in-american-womans-kinky-sex-death/\">had drunk alcohol and possibly taken drugs</a> over the course of the night.He said the autopsy determined that Olsen had suffered two fractures to her skull that were so violent, they alone would have killed her. <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2016/01/12/american-woman-was-choked-to-death-with-a-rope-in-florence-autopsy/\">She was subsequently strangled</a>.Police detained Diaw after DNA analysis came back from a used condom and cigarette butt found in Olsen\u2019s bathroom, as well as DNA samples taken from under her fingernails.Diaw was also tied to the crime because he had taken Olsen\u2019s cellphone, put his own SIM card in it and used it, Creazzo said.\u201cWe have gathered serious indications of guilt against him,\u201d Creazzo said, adding, however, that a judge must confirm the arrest.Prosecutors didn\u2019t say if Diaw had a lawyer or had been assigned a court-appointed lawyer.\n<div class=\"inline-slideshow\" data-component=\"inlineSlideshow\">\n<div

    "2016 - 8637": "GAZIANTEP, Turkey \u2014 Mohammed Saad, a Syrian activist, was imprisoned by the Islamic State group, hung by his arms and beaten regularly. Then one day, his jailors quickly pulled him and other prisoners down and hid them in a bathroom.The reason? A senior Muslim cleric was visiting to inspect the facility. The cleric had told the fighters running the prison that they shouldn\u2019t torture prisoners and that anyone held without charge must be released within 30 days, Saad told the Associated Press. Once the coast was clear, the prisoners were returned to their torment.\u201cIt\u2019s a criminal gang pretending to be a state,\u201d Saad said, speaking in Turkey, where he fled in October. \u201cAll this talk about applying Shariah and Islamic values is just propaganda, Daesh is about torture and killing,\u201d he said, using the Arabic acronym for IS.Syrians who have recently escaped the Islamic State group\u2019s rule say public disillusionment is growing as IS has failed to live up to its promises to install a utopian \u201cIslamic\u201d rule of justice, equality and good governance.Instead, the group has come to resemble the dictatorial rule of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that many Syrians had sought to shed, with a reliance on informers who have silenced a fearful populace. Rather than equality, society has seen the rise of a new elite class \u2014 the jihadi fighters \u2014 who enjoy special perks and favor in the courts, looking down on \u201cthe commoners\u201d and even ignoring the rulings of their own clerics.Despite the atrocities that made it notorious, the Islamic State group had raised hopes among some fellow Sunnis when it overran their territories across parts of Syria and Iraq and declared a \u201ccaliphate\u201d in the summer of 2014. It presented itself as a contrast to Assad\u2019s rule, bringing justice through its extreme interpretation of Shariah and providing services to residents, including loans to farmers, water and electricity, and alms to the poor. Its propaganda machine promoting the dream of an Islamic caliphate helped attract jihadis from around the world.In Istanbul and several Turkish cities near the Syrian border, the AP spoke to more than a dozen Syrians who fled IS-controlled territory in recent months. Most spoke on condition they be identified only by their first names or by the nicknames they use in their political activism for fear of IS reprisals against themselves or family.\u201cDaesh justice has been erratic,\u201d said Nayef, who hails from the IS-held eastern Syrian town of al-Shadadi and escaped to Turkey in November with his family, largely because of Russian airstrikes. \u201cThey started off good and then, gradually, things got worse.\u201d He insisted that his last name not be printed, fearing for his safety.The group has recruited informers in the towns and cities it controls to watch out for any sign of opposition.\u201cLike under the (Assad) regime, we were also afraid to talk against Daesh to anyone we don\u2019t fully trust,\u201d said Fatimah, a 33-year-old whose hometown of Palmyra was taken over by IS early last year. She fled to Turkey in November with her husband and five children to escape Russian and Syrian airstrikes.IS has also become less able to provide public services, in large part because military reversals appear to have put strains on its finances. US and Russian airstrikes have heavily hit its oil infrastructure \u2014 a major source of funds. Over the past year, the group has lost 30 percent of the territory it once held in Iraq and Syria, according to the US-led anti-IS coalition. Many of those interviewed by the AP said there are lengthier cutoffs of water and electricity in their towns and cities and prices for oil and gas have risen.Abu Salem, an activist from the eastern city of Deir el-Zour, said public acceptance of IS rule is eroding. \u201cIt has made an enemy of almost everyone,\u201d he told the AP in the Turkish city of Reyhanli on the Syrian border.One sign of the distance between the claims and realities is a 12-page manifesto by IS detailing its judicial system. The document, a copy of which was obtained by the AP, heavily emphasizes justice and tolerance. For example, it sets out the duties of the Hisba, the \u201creligious police\u201d who ensure people adhere to the group\u2019s dress codes, strict separation of genders and other rules.A Hisba member \u201cmust be gentle and pleasant toward those he orders or reprimands,\u201d it says. \u201cHe must be flexible and good mannered so that his influence is greater and the response (he gets) is stronger.\u201dYet the escaped Syrians all complained of the brutal extremes that the Hisba resorts to. One woman who lived in Raqqa said that if a woman is considered to have violated the dress codes, the militants flog her husband, since he is seen as responsible for her. When her neighbor put out the garbage without being properly covered, she said, the woman\u2019s husband was whipped.Abu Manaf, a 44-year-old from Deir el-Zour, said some clerics challenged the group\u2019s enforcers over their wanton use of strict Shariah punishments like beheadings, stoning to death, flogging and cutting off limbs. More moderate clerics in IS argued that such punishments can only be implemented under specific conditions. They also complained about the jihadis\u2019 custom of displaying bodies of the beheaded in public as an example to others, violating Islamic tenets requiring the swift burial of the dead.\u201cMany of those moderate clerics disappear, are killed or jailed for crimes they did not commit,\u201d said Abu Manaf, who left Deir el-Zour in November, then stayed in the Islamic State group\u2019s de facto capital, Raqqa, for three weeks before he reached Turkey.Saad\u2019s account of his imprisonment in his home city of Deir el-Zour reflected the tensions between the fighters and some clerics.He was arrested because of his media activism, reporting on the anti-Assad opposition. IS suspected him of belonging to the rebel Free Syrian Army, which is fighting the extremists. The day the cleric came to inspect the prison \u2014 set up in a former police station \u2014 he heard the cleric asking the guards if the prisoners were getting enough food and water, and whether they were being beaten, Saad said.On another occasion, a cleric and a judge visited and spoke to the prisoners in their cells. Saad said they told him to write on a piece of paper his name, why he\u2019d been jailed and whether he had been tortured or made to confess under duress. He wrote that he had not been beaten, because he knew the guards would punish him if he said he had been, Saad said.After five months in custody, Saad said, he secured his release by agreeing to do media work for IS. For three months, he helped put together videos and other propaganda before escaping to Turkey.The Syrians interviewed in Turkey said that in IS courts, the judges often show a bias toward IS operatives in any legal dispute with the general public. Judges justify the bias by pointing to Quranic verses or sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, including \u201cGod prefers those who fight in jihad over those who sit.\u201d Often, IS members refer to the general population by the dismissive term \u201cal-awam,\u201d Arabic for \u201cthe commoners.\u201dHossam, who owned a women\u2019s clothes shop in Raqqa, said IS members receive perks that sharply set them apart from everyone else. In many cases, young men join the group to escape poverty or protect themselves from IS excesses, he and others said. He insisted that his last name not be printed, fearing for his safety.\u201cThose who join Daesh receive a step up in the social ladder,\u201d he told the AP in Istanbul. \u201cDaesh men drive luxury cars and eat at the best restaurants and whoever has a friend or a relative with Daesh has a better life.\u201dOne perk that IS members avail themselves of is the chance to marry local women. Several of the Syrians interviewed by the AP said families with daughters often came under pressure to marry them off to fighters, which has led many to smuggle daughters to Turkey.Khatar, a 26-year-old who spoke in Lesbos, Greece, making her way to Western Europe, said she has two younger sisters back in Raqqa, and jihadis \u201chave been knocking on our doors at least once a month to ask for their hands in marriage.\u201d Her father lies to them and tells them he doesn\u2019t have unmarried daughters, \u201cbut they keep coming back.\u201dBut some take the opportunity to marry an IS member because the benefits lift the whole family out of the \u201cal-awam\u201d class.Khatar said a 17-year-old daughter of one of her neighbors married a Saudi jihadi. When Khatar went to congratulate her, she found her loaded with expensive clothes and jewelry as a dowry. \u201cShe seemed very happy with her new, elevated social status,\u201d Khatar said.",
    "2016 - 1659": "An American tourist was brutally stabbed to death at a deserted beach on the Caribbean island of Grenada on Saturday, according to police who say the suspect quickly turned himself in.The 39-year-old woman had been walking in the sand with her husband when the attacker stabbed her with a cutlass, a short sword, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/12120890/American-woman-tourist-murdered-with-cutlass-on-Grenada-beach.html\">The Telegraph reports</a>.Her husband escaped the attack, police said, and the woman\u2019s body turned up near the water.

    "2016 - 4893": "They were kidnapped and then subjected to months of brutal sexual assaults.And as if being the sex slave of an Islamic State fighter isn\u2019t horrific enough, countless women and girls were then subjected to further humiliation \u2014 barbaric and appalling virginity tests.Those who escaped and survived to reveal the horrors that they endured at the hands of Islamic State militants were <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/01/27/dispatches-virginity-testing-end-yezidi-rape-survivors\">forced to undergo the tests conducted by Kurdistan officials,</a> according to Human Rights Watch.\u201cThe girls underwent the abusive and inaccurate procedure as part of a forensic, post-rape examination,\u201d Rothna Begum, an HRW Women\u2019s Rights Division researcher, said in a recent Dispatches report.She said the tests were seen as evidence of rape by Iraqi courts, despite the World Health Organization stating definitively that \u201cvirginity tests\u201d have no scientific validity.\u201cThey are based on a commonly held but inaccurate belief that all women and girls who are virgins have intact hymens that bleed on first intercourse,\u201d she said.\u201cAs such they are ineffective for determining whether a woman or girl has been raped.\u201dBegum, who interviewed dozens of girls who were captured by ISIS fighters when they swept through northern Iraq in August 2014, said the girls were in dire need of health care, counseling and other services to help them begin to recover from their ordeal.While their stories were taken seriously, some of the girls were subjected to the horrific tests, she added, further adding to their trauma.The committee gathering evidence of ISIS crimes this week revealed it had stopped referring sex slave survivors for virginity tests.Instead they were adopting a new medical examination report on sexual violence based on UN recommendations, consistent with human rights and best practice, HRW reveal.The revelation about the testing comes as more stories unfold of the brutal acts ISIS militants have inflicted on women and girls, many of whom were sold and purchased as sex slaves.It is estimated between 3,000 and 5,000 women and girls are enslaved by ISIS, most of whom come from the Yazidi minority, who are persecuted as \u201cdevil worshippers.\u201dIn a November 2015 testimony, <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/woman-burnt-alive-by-islamic-state-for-refusing-extreme-sex-act/news-story/46e0b83f698a005ded63b0e8ebdb9a79\">Zainab Bangura, the UN\u2019s special representative on sexual violence in conflict, revealed how ISIS was institutionalizing sexual violence</a> and how brutalizing women and girls is central to their ideology.She said fighters who captured new territory often killed men and young boys, taking the youngest and prettiest virgins to their stronghold in Raqqa.Some girls are sold several times as fighters tire of them, or in some cases killed.\u201cWe heard one case of a 20-year-old girl who was burned alive because she refused to perform an extreme sex act,\u201d she told the committee.Another survivor of ISIS brutality also shared the horror of her ordeal at the hands of militants.<a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/they-forced-us-to-pray-before-raping-us-isis-sex-slave-survivor-speaks-out/news-story/d0476d9fab9e0e541d25ddc3926ad90f\">Nadia Murad, 21, was captured by fighters in her hometown of Sinjar in northern Iraq</a> before being sold into sexual slavery last year.Speaking about her ordeal at Egypt\u2019s Cairo University last November, she said militants \u201cused to force captives to pray and then rape us.\u201d\u201cWe were not worth the value of animals. They raped girls in groups. They did what a mind could not imagine.\u201dAs barbaric as it sounds for rape victims, virginity testing has also come under fire in Indonesia, where <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/world/asia/indonesias-national-police-accused-of-virginity-tests-for-female-recruits/news-story/b412c315152fd5570c4e44dd60695730\">female police recruits have reportedly been subjected to the practice.</a>In a 2014 report, HRW said many young women described the procedure as painful and traumatic.The women told how they were forced to strip naked before being given a \u201ctwo-finger test\u201d to see if their hymens were intact.The practice is also extended to female recruits looking to join the country\u2019s military service.But while the testing has been widely condemned by women and human rights activists, it appears the army\u2019s top boss doesn\u2019t have a problem with it.In an interview with the Jakarta Globe last year,<a href=\"http://jakartaglobe.beritasatu.com/news/good-thing-military-chief-virginity-testing-female-recruits/\"> General Moeldoko defended the procedure, reportedly saying, \u201cSo what\u2019s the problem?

    "2016 - 6430": "Suppose they gave an Oscars ceremony and nobody came? Or rather, suppose they threw another tedious, self-congratulatory Hollywood circle jerk \u2014 and just a few white people showed up?This is the fate facing Tinseltown\u2019s most overrated awards fete, scheduled for Feb 28. Some African-Americans, and at least one white supporter, vow to skip the annual celebration of liberal politics, Botox and racism so blatant that not a single person of color was nominated this year or last for an acting Academy Award. No movie starring racial minorities has a shot at winning a Best Picture statue this year.Who\u2019s responsible for this travesty? Don\u2019t blame political conservatives. We discriminated against no one. Republicans \u2014 all-purpose boo\u00adgey\u00adpeople to the radical left \u2014 didn\u2019t warp the film world.And patriotic Americans, who\u2019ve been dashed repeatedly by the Oscars\u2019 rejection of films that reflect their values, committed no offense.The trouncing of La-La Land diversity is a self-inflicted wound suffered by political progressives who run the realm of rich, hypocritical, Gulfstream jet-flying warriors against climate change and income inequality.Apparently, partly in response to the viral hashtag #OscarsSoWhite, overlords of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced that they aim to double its\u00a0number of women and \u201cdiverse\u201d members \u2014 by 2020.The struggle for millionaires\u2019 civil rights will not wait.Will Smith is leading a boycott charge with his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, and filmmakers Spike Lee and Michael Moore. Smith said on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d \u2014 insultingly \u2014 that the nominations demonstrate racial inequities plaguing the United States, which presumably he experiences from behind tinted limousine windows.\u201cWhen I look at it, the nominations reflect the academy. The academy reflects the industry, reflects Hollywood, and then the industry reflects America,\u201d he lectured. \u201cIt reflects a series of challenges that we are having in our country at the moment.\u201cThere\u2019s a regressive slide towards separatism, towards racial and religious disharmony, and that\u2019s not the Hollywood that I want to leave behind. That\u2019s not the industry, that\u2019s not the America, I want to leave behind.\u201dWord to the academy-overlooked \u201cConcussion\u2019\u2019 star: This is no vast right-wing conspiracy.Oscars were awarded on a more consistently racially diverse basis during the presidency of Republican George W. Bush than they are under Democrat Barack Obama. During the Bush years, Halle Berry, Denzel Washington and Jamie Foxx took home statues for leading roles, and Jennifer Hudson nabbed one for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.The last film featuring blacks to be lavishly honored by the academy was 2013\u2019s \u201c12 Years a Slave,\u2019\u2019 a brutal but important work based on the true story of a free black man kidnapped from upstate New York and enslaved in the 19th-century South.It won Oscars for Best Picture, supporting actress and adapted screenplay.Now, jump to this year.The 2015 biopic \u201cStraight Outta Compton,\u201d which I thoroughly enjoyed, is an uplifting dramatization of the rags-to-riches journey of N.W.A. The African-American members of the 1980s rap group are shown overcoming street gangs, drugs, brutality purportedly inflicted by racist cops, and the FBI, which tried and failed to silence the catchy rap, \u201cF- -k tha Police.\u201d Perhaps that sentiment would best be directed at the academy.The movie\u2019s only Oscar nomination is for Best Original Screenplay.Meanwhile, the white-dominated \u201cMad Max: Fury Road\u2019\u2019 (I missed this one) is a post-apocalyptic car-chase movie not starring Mel Gibson. It nabbed 10 nominations, including ones for Best Picture and Directing.Hollywood is sick with an even bigger prejudice \u2014 a pathological disdain for flag-waving, pro-military films.Most gallingly, 2014\u2019s box-office monster \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d got virtually no respect from the academy. Directed by Clint Eastwood, the film about Navy SEAL sharpshooter Chris Kyle, beautifully played by Bradley Cooper, was nominated for six Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Actor. (Eastwood wasn\u2019t nominated.) The movie scored just one statue for sound editing.The good news is that we shall overcome Hollywood racism. But I guarantee that out-of-touch movieland leftists won\u2019t exhibit love for America anytime soon.In my column last week, I confessed that I\u2019m Team Circumcision, which pissed off Team Foreskin.\u201cYour disregard for victims reminds me of rape apologists and Holocaust denialists,\u2019\u2019 reader Carrie Arnese wrote in an email.\u201cIntactivists\u2019\u2019 are men who feel mutilated from having the foreskins snipped from their penises as babies, and women who believe the procedures are painful, barbaric and unnecessary.But Carl Monetti, 66, wrote that he could not be intimate with women until after he was cut while serving in the Air Force: \u201cTrust me, I would much rather have gone through the procedure as a baby than at 21.\u2019\u2019Popular in the United States, though the rate has dipped in recent years, circumcision safeguards men from certain cancers and sexually transmitted diseases, studies show. Intactivists contend the health claims are overblown, and say that about 100 males die each year as a result of genital alteration.It\u2019s about aesthetics for me. I\u2019m not switching teams.The skinny chick has grown love handles!Appeasing feminists while trying to pump up plummeting sales, toymakers at Mattel last week unveiled fat Barbies.
