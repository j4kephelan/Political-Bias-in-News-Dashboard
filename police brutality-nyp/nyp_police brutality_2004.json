    "2004 - 830": "A brutal gang-stabbing that left a Queens teen dead and his pal critically injured stemmed from a long simmering feud the victims had with their attackers, his friends said yesterday.   Chimei \u201cJimmy\u201d Chan, 15, died on the front stoop of 136-42 Maple Ave. in Flushing on Friday, police said.   His pal, Peter King, 18, was critically wounded.   Seven suspects have been arrested.   Friends said Chan had been chased by members of a neighborhood clique known as the Asian Eternity, which targets Chinese-Americans.   They didn\u2019t know what sparked the stabbing.   \u201cIt\u2019s been three years since Jimmy and this group have been fighting. It started in junior high school,\u201d said Jennifer, Chan\u2019s godsister who didn\u2019t want to give her last name.  \u201cThey beat him with a pipe when he was only 12. Since then he has clashed with this group.\u201d",
    "2004 - 2475": "Alleged Upper East Side sex predator Kevin White saved his worst brutalities for his male victims, including a vicious violation during which he told one man he was going to go \u201cTaliban\u201d on him, details released yesterday reveal.  \u201cThis\u2019ll cut your insides open,\u201d White allegedly taunted as he violated a 25-year-old man with a pair of scissors in the victim\u2019s East 83rd Street apartment.  \u201cI\u2019m going to go Taliban on you [sic] ass and send you to Allah,\u201d White added, as he allegedly dragged the man around the apartment by a necktie he\u2019d tied around his throat.  The horrific details of violence and manipulation are contained in the criminal complaint charging White, 34, of Jersey City, with attacks on two men and three women.  In all five cases, White \u2013 who has a history of 26 misdemeanor arrests plus a weapons conviction \u2013 was allegedly after money. But the details released yesterday suggest he wanted to humiliate his victims sexually as well.  In his first known attack, on the Lower East Side in October, cops say he tied, gagged and threatened to commit a sexual crime against a transvestite after forcing himself into the victim\u2019s East Second Street apartment.  Then came White\u2019s alleged weeklong Upper East Side rampage. \u201cI have a gun, give me money,\u201d he allegedly demanded of a 23-year-old woman on Jan. 24. She complied without injury. But the thug was just warming up.  \u201cGive me money or I\u2019ll shoot,\u201d he allegedly demanded of an 18-year-old woman on Jan. 27. He forced her to withdraw cash from an ATM, then sexually assaulted her in her building\u2019s vestibule.  The next attack, on Jan. 29, was the most vicious. White allegedly followed the 25-year-old man into his vestibule, threatening with his hand in his pocket, \u201cI have a 9 mm gun; you know what is up.\u201d The victim handed over what money he had on him, but White allegedly wanted more, marching the man to an ATM.  White allegedly then forced the man back home, ordering him to strip. The victim was anally and orally sodomized in his own bathroom and then violated with a pair of scissors White allegedly grabbed from the kitchen.  He allegedly left the victim tied with neckties to the toilet and sink, then returned and ordered the man to dress and accompany him to the ATM to withdraw more money. His most recent attack was Jan. 30 against a 24-year-old woman.  He was arrested Saturday after a victim identified him from police mug shots. All five victims later ID\u2019d him in a lineup, cops said. ",
    "2004 - 1957": "A judge has revealed for the first time that prosecutors suspect Danny Pelosi and a small number of friends and relatives killed millionaire Ted Ammon.  Suffolk County Supreme Court Justice Robert Doyle made the disclosure in rejecting a grand jury\u2019s request to look at Pelosi\u2019s defense files.  The files requested include interviews \u2013 by private eyes who worked for Pelosi and his late wife, Generosa \u2013 of possible suspects in Ammon\u2019s murder at his East Hampton mansion in October 2001.  The panel had requested the material to check out prosecution claims that Pelosi \u201cand a small entourage of friends and relatives had participated in the murder,\u201d Doyle said in his ruling Tuesday.  Doyle denied the request on the ground of attorney-client privilege.  The grand jury probing the unsolved slaying had issued two subpoenas seeking the \u201cinterview notes, materials and reports\u201d compiled by the private investigators.  The subpoenas named seven witnesses or potential suspects in the brutal bludgeoning murder.  Pelosi\u2019s lawyer, Paul Bergman, fought the subpoena, arguing that it was privileged attorney-client information and was crucial to his client\u2019s defense.  Bergman also said the ruling validated the confidential nature of the joint defense agreement between Pelosi and his wife, who was Ammon\u2019s widow.   \u201cIt\u2019s very unusual for the prosecution to think that they could obtain this type of information,\u201d Bergman said.  Pelosi told The Post he is optimistic the ruling means the investigation is winding down and he will not be indicted.  \u201cI hope that this will soon be over and I can go forward with my life,\u201d said Pelosi, who has a contracting business.  Suffolk homicide squad detectives arrested five people close to Pelosi on minor charges last April, and grilled them in the murder. They included Pelosi\u2019s cousin, three friends and his former wife.  They all protested their innocence and later filed a federal lawsuit claiming police brutality. ",
    "2004 - 2002": "For a few hours yesterday, even the elements seemed to fall in line and salute fallen police Sgt. Keith Ferguson, the Emergency Service Unit officer who died last Saturday at only 38.   In what has otherwise been a brutal winter, the lower Manhattan skies radiated with sunlight and basked hundreds of officers in the plaza at St. Andrew\u2019s Catholic Church for the funeral Mass with the warmth many said embodied Ferguson.   \u201cHe always had that warm smile on his face and a good laugh,\u201d said Detective Tim Murphy, who served in Ferguson\u2019s ESU 7 anti-terrorism team. \u201cIf we were planning to play a prank on someone, he\u2019d be the first one to get on the phone and start calling other people to get involved.   \u201cAnd he followed it through to make sure it went off.\u201d   Ferguson died from an apparent heart attack while coming to the aid of an officer chasing an illegal vendor down a SoHo street.   Mayor Bloomberg said Ferguson died doing what he loved best \u2013 being an active cop.   \u201cIt was not a surprise to anyone who knew Keith that he was the first out of the car and first to give chase,\u201d said Bloomberg, adding: \u201cHe lived by example . . . He lived and he died protecting our city.\u201d   Edward Mullins, president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association, said Ferguson and the elite ESU team were a match made in law-enforcement heaven.   \u201cHe was a guy who never sat back, and Emergency Services doesn\u2019t sit back,\u201d said Mullins.   \u201cThey actually chose a perfect assignment for him.\u201d   Commissioner Raymond Kelly said Ferguson, a 17-year veteran, was \u201ceverything you\u2019d want in a police officer and more.\u201d   He said after Ferguson returned from a stint in Bosnia, where he helped the government establish a police force, he demanded a more trying assignment \u2013 to be a member of the Emergency Service Unit.   \u201cHe was a role model for all of us,\u201d the commissioner noted.   Ferguson\u2019s dad, Victor Ferguson, a retired NYPD officer, said in a statement: \u201cI am very proud of my son. He died doing what he loved.\u201d ",
    "2004 - 2662": "Long Island cops say they have cracked the case of the brutal murder of a commuter just feet from his home, busting a young woman along with four Latin King gang members who told jokes and laughed while in custody yesterday.   The five are charged with slaying Anthony Battaglia, 37, while trying to rob him as he walked to his Lynbrook home from an LIRR station last Sept. 19.   Battaglia\u2019s wife, Caryn, said she believed her dead husband helped nab his alleged killers \u2013 all Freeport, L.I., residents who were arrested over the past two days.   \u201cI know that Tony was involved. I know he is sending us these messages that we are not alone. He\u2019s still here, he\u2019s still around us, and he will see us through,\u201d she said.   Nassau County police told Caryn of the busts as she prepared to go to her job as an assistant teacher at a day-care center, where their daughter, Stephanie, celebrated her fourth birthday.   \u201cI\u2019m still shaking,\u201d she said hours later.   The slain man\u2019s mother, Ethel Battaglia, 76, of Queens, said: \u201cGlory be to God . . . My prayers are answered.\u201d   Police said Battaglia was accosted near his home by the suspects \u2013 who are believed to have robbed a couple in Rockville Centre earlier that night.   Cops said the suspects shot Battaglia in the hip and stabbed him twice in the stomach before fleeing empty-handed.   Battaglia managed to stumble to his back door, where his wife found him.   Detective Lt. Dennis Farrell said Battaglia \u201cwas truly a random target.\u201d   Two suspects, Nelson Zuniga, 19, and Omar Delarosa, 18, were charged with first-degree murder. Cops said Zuniga shot Battaglia and that Delarosa stabbed him.   Janny Paez, 20, Fernando Moranta, 20, were charged with second-degree murder, as was Marina Musso, 21, a woman who allegedly was the getaway driver. All five also were charged with attempted robbery and held without bail.   A law-enforcement source said the men laughed during booking yesterday.   \u201cTo them, this is a big joke \u2013 they have no remorse,\u201d the source said.   Cops got their break last fall after several police traffic stops of a Nissan Xterra driven by Musso, which matched a description of an SUV that fled the murder scene.   Freeport Officer Chris Pandolfo said he knew Musso acted as a chauffeur to Latin Kings gang members, one of whom was with her during the stops that he made.   Although he had no reason to arrest them then, Pandolfo called Nassau County homicide detectives to alert them to the possible connection of the SUV to the murder.   Another tip came from a call made to the Crime Stoppers hot line that said the same crew of suspects was spotted in Brooklyn in an SUV, police said. ",
    "2004 - 5508": "The adorable 11-year-old Florida girl whose kidnapping was caught on camera put up a desperate fight against her abductor before being killed, a source close to the investigation told The Post yesterday.   Carlie Brucia, whose body was found yesterday just a few miles from where she went missing, was kidnapped and brutally murdered by tattooed ex-con Joseph Smith, 37, police said.   \u201cThe initial review of the body indicates she put up a real struggle before she died,\u201d the source said of the spunky Sarasota sixth-grader and Long Island native.   \u201cShe fought desperately. She put up a huge fight.\u201d   In a crime that is every parent\u2019s worst nightmare, Carlie was snatched while walking home Sunday night from a friend\u2019s house.   The kidnapping sparked national attention because it was captured on a surveillance camera at Evie\u2019s Car Wash, about a half-mile from Carlie\u2019s home.   The source added that Carlie was killed within a few hours of her kidnapping \u2013 and that cops had an encounter with Smith at about 10 p.m. that night near the thick underbrush where the victim\u2019s body was found.   Patrolling cops spotted Smith\u2019s Buick station wagon \u2013 believed to have been used in the abduction \u2013 parked illegally under an overpass off I-75.   When they spotted the auto mechanic and Brooklyn native return to his car after emerging from some thick underbrush, they asked him what he was doing.   Smith, who has been charged with murder and kidnapping, \u201csaid he went to pee \u2013 and the cops let him go,\u201d said the source.   The next morning, Smith showed up late for his job \u2013 and was acting \u201cstrangely,\u201d the source said.   \u201cHe kept washing his hands over and over even though they were clean,\u201d the source said.   \u201cAnd he told his boss that he might have to leave the state at any time.\u201d   Carlie\u2019s distraught dad, Joseph Brucia, pleaded yesterday with Florida Gov. Jeb Bush to investigate the judges who allowed Smith to remain free despite his lengthy rap sheet.   \u201cHe should not have been out in the street,\u201d said Brucia, his voice breaking, at an afternoon news conference outside the carwash.   Smith, who could face the death penalty, was arrested Tuesday on an unrelated drug charge and identified Wednesday as the man in the videotape.   In the chilling video, a man sporting tattoos on both forearms and wearing a mechanic\u2019s shirt with a nametag is seen snatching Carlie.   Brucia added that his beloved daughter, who sang in the chorus and loved playing sports and going to the mall with friends, was killed \u201cin a horrific manner.\u201d   Carlie\u2019s body was discovered at about 1 a.m. in some thick underbrush near the parking lot of the Central Church of Christ, off I-75.   Investigators were reportedly tipped off to the spot by a jail inmate who told officials that Smith had allegedly confessed the crime and the location to him.   Carlie\u2019s mom, Susan Schorpen, was numb with grief after getting the horrific news she had been dreading, racing out of the house in tears and screaming in agony.   \u201cHe killed my daughter. He murdered my daughter. He murdered my baby,\u201d family friend Chessie Huber quoted the mother as saying.   Yesterday morning, a choked-up Sarasota County Sheriff Bill Balkwill broke the tragic news to the public.   \u201cThe body of a beautiful, lovely little girl, Carlie Brucia, has been found,\u201d said Balkwill, his voice cracking.   \u201cJoseph Smith is under arrest for the abduction and murder of Carlie. On behalf of the entire law-enforcement team, the citizens who volunteered, our sympathy goes out to the entire family of Carlie.\u201d   Authorities did not say how the angelic blue-eyed blonde had been killed or whether she had been sexually abused.   Sarasota County Sheriff Capt. Jeff Bell said Smith, who has not been cooperating with authorities, \u201cwill pay the ultimate price for what he did to her.\u201d   Just hours after cops made the gruesome discovery, Carlie\u2019s stepdad, Steven Kansler, and some friends prayed at the edge of the Central Church of Christ.   Meanwhile, Carlie\u2019s grandparents in Wantagh, L.I., were beside themselves with grief.   \u201cThere\u2019s really nothing anybody can do at this point,\u201d said Joseph Brucia Sr., fighting back tears. \u201cIt\u2019s just awful.\u201d   Carlie moved with her mom to Florida in 1993 after her parents divorced. Her dad still lives in Bellmore, L.I.   Bob Hagemann, Carlie\u2019s principal at MacIntosh Middle School, called the victim \u201ca shining light\u201d in the classroom.   On Thursday, Schorpen, in her first public comments since her daughter\u2019s kidnapping, pleaded for Carlie\u2019s safe return.   \u201cI need my daughter home,\u201d Schorpen said.   \u201cShe\u2019s a very, very important part of this family and community.\u201d   Chuck Chambers, a private investigator hired by Carlie\u2019s family, said yesterday, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do to make anybody feel better, and it\u2019s going to hurt for a long, long time.\u201d   Friends and classmates fondly recalled Carlie as sweet, fun-loving and good-natured.   \u201cShe was loving and caring,\u201d said close friend Tiffany Meeks.   \u201cShe doesn\u2019t like to see other people hurt. She\u2019d be really crying if this was one of us or someone else she knows. It\u2019s just hard to talk about.\u201d   Smith has at least 13 arrests in Florida since 1993.   He was arrested in 1997 on kidnapping and false-imprisonment charges, but was acquitted a year later.   The divorced father of three, who\u2019s set to be arraigned by today, also served 17 months in prison in 2001 and 2002 for heroin possession and prescription-drug fraud.
