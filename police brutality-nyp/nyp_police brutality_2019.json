    "2019 - 2431": "A <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/europe\">German</a>\u00a0politician who left the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party after a racist tirade is setting up a new party that has adopted a symbol used by Austrian Nazis and an anti-Semitic group in the 1930s.Andr\u00e9 Poggenburg led the AfD, often described as far-right over its anti-Muslim and anti-immigration rhetoric, to its strongest state election performance yet, winning almost a quarter of the vote in Saxony-Anhalt in 2016.But the regional leader resigned last year after labeling Turks \u201ccamel drivers\u201d and immigrants with dual nationality a \u201chomeless mob we no longer want to have.\u201d He recently criticized the AfD for becoming increasingly left-wing amid fears of being under surveillance by Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency.His new party \u2014 named Awakening of German Patriots (AdP) \u2014 drew immediate criticism after revealing that its logo features a blue cornflower, a known symbol of hate.In neighboring Austria, the flower has been associated with the anti-Semitic Schoenerer Movement and was used as a secret symbol by Nazi sympathizers until the country was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938.Poggenburg told German news agency DPA\u00a0that his movement may enter state parliament in regional elections this year but also said elsewhere that he doesn\u2019t want his party to directly compete with the AfD.This is the fourth time a split has emerged in the party\u00a0that has sent shockwaves through the German political establishment since the migrant crisis in 2015 that resulted in Germany welcoming 1 million refugees.AfD co-leader Frauke Petry left the party in 2017 and formed the Blue Party, which has two seats in the national parliament. Bernhard Wildt, a regional AfD leader, also left the party to found a group called Citizens for Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.Earlier this month, a member of the AfD was seriously injured <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/world/german-far-right-politician-brutally-beaten-in-assassination-attempt-party-says\">after being attacked by three people in the northern city of Bremen</a> in what the party described as an \u201cassassination attempt.\u201dThe party said Frank Magnitz was knocked unconscious after leaving a New Year\u2019s reception. The party praised \u201cthe courageous intervention of a builder\u201d with saving Magnitz\u2019s life and said the police and the Bremen prosecutor\u2019s office are investigating the attack.",
    "2019 - 2833": "A burly, 250-pound North Carolina man was arrested after video showed him punching an 11-year-old girl in the face, sending her to the ground with a brutal left hook, video shows.David Steven Bell, 51, of Black Mountain, attacked the victim after a throng of young girls surrounded him outside the Asheville Mall on Saturday, when the 6-foot-5 man shoved one of them during a heated exchange, video shows.The girl raised her hands and ran back toward Bell \u2013 who then decked her, sending her to the ground in an instant. The other young girls with the victim, as well as other witnesses, began screaming as the brief recording ended while some of them ran back inside the mall.Bell, who did not return a request seeking comment Tuesday, was booked on three charges, including assault on a child under the age of 12 for punching the 11-year-old girl, according to arrest warrants <a href=\"https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2019/01/14/asheville-mall-incident-black-mountain-man-assaulted-3-girls-warrants-say/2571496002/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">obtained Monday by the Asheville Citizen Times</a>.Bell is also facing two counts of assault on a female after two 13-year-old girls in the crowd later told police that he shoved them during the altercation as well, a police spokeswoman told the newspaper.The condition of the 11-year-old girl \u2013 who was not named \u2013 remains unclear. Attempts by the Citizen Times to reach her relatives or someone to speak on her behalf were unsuccessful. Two representatives for the 13-year-old girls, meanwhile, declined to comment, the newspaper reports.A mall spokeswoman said the incident is being reviewed to determine if adjustments are needed to the facility\u2019s security protocols.\u201cSome measures are visible to the public and others are not,\u201d spokeswoman Catharine Wells said. \u201cIn addition to maintaining a full-time professional security team, we partner with the Asheville Police Department and hire off-duty officers to patrol the interior and exterior of the property.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t clear what immediately preceded the confrontation, but some on social media took exception to the fact that Bell was charged with misdemeanor offenses.\u201cMall cops hardly took the thing seriously and local police charged the man with a damn misdemeanor,\u201d one woman wrote. \u201cHe\u2019s already out. A misdemeanor. I\u2019m furious.\u201dAnother comment noted that Bell could\u2019ve \u201ceasily killed\u201d the girl with the brutal left-handed blow.\u201cThis is disgusting,\u201d one comment read. \u201cWho in their right mind finds it okay to punch an eleven year old girl? Especially being as large as he is. It saddens me that this hatred is in a town that I hold dear to my heart and has always had such a peaceful environment.\u201dBell is scheduled to appear in court on Feb. 5, court records show. It was unclear if he had hired an attorney.",
    "2019 - 4814": "MANILA, Philippines \u2014 Two bombs tore through a Roman Catholic cathedral on a southern Philippine island where Muslim militants are active, killing at least 21 people and wounding more than 70 during a Sunday Mass, officials said.The first bomb went off in or near the Jolo cathedral in the provincial capital, followed by a second blast outside the compound as government forces were responding to the attack, security officials said. The blasts blew away the entrance to the cathedral and ripped through the main hall, shredding to pieces the pews and toppling other doors.Police said at least 21 people died and 71 were wounded. The dead included 14 civilians and seven soldiers, said Chief Superintendent Graciano Mijares, police director for the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.Photos showed debris and bodies lying on a busy street outside the Cathedral of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, which has been hit by bombs in the past. Troops in armored carriers sealed off the main road leading to the church while vehicles transported the dead and wounded to the hospital. Some casualties were evacuated by air to nearby Zamboanga city.\u201cI have directed our troops to heighten their alert level, secure all places of worships and public places at once, and initiate pro-active security measures to thwart hostile plans,\u201d said Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana in a statement.\u201cWe will pursue to the ends of the earth the ruthless perpetrators behind this dastardly crime until every killer is brought to justice and put behind bars. The law will give them no mercy,\u201d the office of President Rodrigo Duterte said in Manila.It said that \u201cthe enemies of the state boldly challenged the government\u2019s capability to secure the safety of citizens in that region. The (Armed Forces of the Philippines) will rise to the challenge and crush these godless criminals.\u201dJolo island has long been troubled by the presence of Abu Sayyaf militants, who are blacklisted by the United States and the Philippines as a terrorist organization because of years of bombings, kidnappings and beheadings. A Catholic bishop, Benjamin de Jesus, was gunned down by suspected militants outside the cathedral in 1997.No one has immediately claimed responsibility for the latest attack.It came nearly a week after minority Muslims in the predominantly Roman Catholic nation endorsed a new autonomous region in the southern Philippines in hopes of ending nearly five decades of a separatist rebellion that has left 150,000 people dead. Although most of the Muslim areas approved the autonomy deal, voters in Sulu province, where Jolo is located, rejected it. The province is home to a rival rebel faction that\u2019s opposed to the deal as well as smaller militant cells that not part of any peace process.Western governments have welcomed the autonomy pact. They worry that small numbers of Islamic State-linked militants from the Middle East and Southeast Asia could forge an alliance with Filipino insurgents and turn the south into a breeding ground for extremists.\u201cThis bomb attack was done in a place of peace and worship, and it comes at a time when we are preparing for another stage of the peace process in Mindanao,\u201d said Gov. Mujiv Hataman of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. \u201cHuman lives are irreplaceable,\u201d he added, calling on Jolo residents to cooperate with authorities to find the perpetrators of this \u201catrocity.\u201dSecurity officials were looking \u201cat different threat groups and they still can\u2019t say if this has something to do with the just concluded plebiscite,\u201d Albayalde, the national police chief, told ABS-CBN TV network.Aside from the small but brutal Abu Sayyaf group, other militant groups in Sulu include a small band of young jihadis aligned with the Islamic State group, which has also carried out assaults, including ransom kidnappings and beheadings.Abu Sayyaf militants are still holding at least five hostages \u2014 a Dutch national, two Malaysians, an Indonesian and a Filipino \u2014 in their jungle bases mostly near Sulu\u2019s Patikul town, not far from Jolo.Government forces have pressed on sporadic offensives to crush the militants, including those in Jolo, a poverty-wracked island of more than 700,000 people. A few thousand Catholics live mostly in the capital of Jolo.There have been speculations that the bombings may be a diversionary move by Muslim militants after troops recently carried out an offensive that killed a number of IS-linked extremists in an encampment in the hinterlands of Lanao del Sur province, also in the south. The area is near Marawi, a Muslim city that was besieged for five months by hundreds of IS-aligned militants, including foreign fighters, in 2017. Troops quelled the insurrection, which left more 1,100 mostly militants dead and the heartland of the mosque-studded city in ruins.",
