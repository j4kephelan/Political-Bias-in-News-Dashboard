AFFIDAVIT FROM VAN DER SLOOT EXTORTION CASE</a>\nAt 5:12 a.m., they leave. Minutes later, van der Sloot led her into his hotel room, where he has told police that he killed her.<em></em>Guardia said van der Sloot, who also remains the lone suspect in the Natalee Holloway missing-teenager case, \u201cconfessed with a wealth of details that have been corroborated through criminal investigative rigor.\u201dGuardia denied any suggestion that van der Sloot\u2019s confession was forced. He said a translator assigned by the Dutch Embassy was present, as was a state-appointed defense attorney.If tried and convicted on murder charges, van der Sloot would face from 15 to 35 years in prison.What remains unresolved is the May 30, 2005 disappearance of Holloway on the Caribbean island of Aruba.Efforts by the FBI to try to resolve it may have inadvertently helped fund the travel that enabled the murder \u2014 exactly five years to the day after the Alabama teen vanished \u2014 of Lima business student Stephany Flores.Believing it was closing in on van der Sloot, the FBI videotaped and paid him $25,000 in a sting operation in Aruba last month, investigators told the AP. But it held off on arresting him, and he took the money and flew to Peru.Peruvian interrogators restricted their questioning of Van der Sloot to the case of Flores, the daughter of a circus promoter and former race car driver whom he met playing poker at a casino, Guardia said.He told the AP in an interview Wednesday evening that the 6-foot-3 (190-centimeter-tall) van der Sloot, 22, impressed investigators with both his intelligence and brutality.\u201cHe grabbed her and smashed her with an elbow,\u201d Guardia said, pointing to his own nose. \u201cA lot of blood spewed out \u2026 Then he strangles her and throws her to the floor.\u201d\u201cHe is irascible. He has no self-control,\u201d Guardia said.The general said van der Sloot took Flores\u2019 cash, about US$300 worth of Peruvian currency, two credit cards and her national ID card. He apparently also took her Jeep Cherokee, which was found abandoned blocks away in a lower-class neighborhood.Guardia said Van der Sloot attested in his confession to killing Flores because she found out about the Aruba case by using his laptop without his permission. But he said police didn\u2019t necessarily believe him and think he may have killed Flores before going out and returning to the room with two cups of coffee and rolls.\u201cThis guy is very intelligent but at times has lapses,\u201d said Guardia. \u201cAnd the truth is that he is not a person in possession of all his senses.\u201dA psychological examination is pending, he said.Van der Sloot is also getting plenty to eat, Guardia said. \u201cIf he wants a steak we give him a steak \u2026 If he wants a cigarette we give him cigarettes.\u201dThe evidence against the Dutchman includes hotel security camera video showing Flores and Van der Sloot entering his hotel room together and the Dutchman leaving alone four hours later.Security camera video from the Atlantic Casino where the two met shows Flores arriving at a poker table where Van der Sloot is sitting with other players, shaking his hand as if they\u2019d met before and then taking the seat next to him. The two later leave together.\u201cThe incriminatory elements were so powerful that he had to confess,\u201d said Guardia.Van der Sloot confessed, police say, on his third full day in police custody and a full week after he fled into northern Chile.He was charged with extortion in the United States on June 2, the day of his arrest in Chile, in a case U.S. law officers and a private investigator say stemmed from work revived in April when Van der Sloot contacted a lawyer for Holloway\u2019s mother. The Dutchman was seeking $250,000 in exchange for the location of the young woman\u2019s body, they said.Van der Sloot\u2019s father died in February and he \u201cwanted to come clean, but he also wanted money,\u201d said the private investigator Bo Dietl, who also told the CBS \u201cEarly Show\u201d today that van der Sloot is a \u201chomicidal maniac.\u201dHolloway\u2019s family said they wanted closure and the attorney, John Kelly, contacted the FBI. It sent 10 to 12 agents to Aruba who set up a sting operation, added Dietl, who works with Kelly.In the operation, Van der Sloot was given $10,000 in cash \u2014 another $15,000 was wired to a bank account in his name \u2014 and told he\u2019d get $225,000 once the body was found, the investigator said.Van der Sloot was secretly videotaped by the FBI in an Aruba hotel telling Kelly he pushed Holloway down, she hit her head on a rock and died, he added.He said he then contacted his father, who helped him bury the body, Dietl added.Under surveillance by the FBI, Kelley and Van der Sloot went to where the body supposedly was buried.No body has been found.The investigation of Van der Sloot in the Holloway case was simply not far enough along to have him arrested, the FBI and the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Birmingham said Wednesday.However, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy quickly asked FBI Director Robert Mueller for an explanation of \u201cexactly what happened in this case and the basis for all actions taken by the FBI.\u201dThe federal criminal complaint in the case says Van der Sloot got a partial payment of $15,000 wired to a Netherlands bank on or around May 10.It did not say where the money came from.In a statement Wednesday, the FBI said only that the payment came from private funds. Holloway\u2019s mother, Beth Twitty, has refused to discuss details of the case and Dietl said he didn\u2019t know the money\u2019s origin.Van der Sloot was the last person seen with her daughter before the girl vanished on the last night of a high school graduation trip. He was arrested twice but released both times for a lack of evidence.Flores\u2019 family was asked Wednesday for comment on the fact that Van der Sloot traveled to Peru less than a week after receiving the cash in the extortion sting.Enrique Flores, one of the slain Peruvian woman\u2019s brothers, said, \u201cMy sister is dead, so I can\u2019t accomplish anything by thinking about what might have been.\u201d\u201cNeither I nor the family are thinking about all the things that could have happened but did not.\u201d",
