The unidentified cyclist was clocked at as high as 130 mph down Roscoe Boulevard in West Hills, Calif., at about 1 p.m. Thursday before slamming head-on into a vehicle making a left turn, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/los-angeles-motorcyclist-dies-horrific-crash-video\">Fox News reported</a>.Cops initially ran the license plate and determined the motorcycle was stolen, LAPD spokesman Sgt. Bruce Borihanh told The Post. The officers then called on an LAPD helicopter to track the motorcyclist, who took off at a high speed.Borihanh said police vehicles did not pursue the motorcyclist. A local CBS news station following the pursuit caught the violent impact live on air. \u201cOh my gosh!\u201d the anchor said while clasping her hands to her face. \u201cWe have just seen \u2014 sorry, we just saw that motorcycle crash into a car there at the intersection.\u201d Borihanh said the motorcyclist was pronounced dead at the scene.",

He illegally left the state when the coronavirus jammed up the court system and attacked a California officer last January, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/brianna-kupfers-alleged-killer-shawn-smith-once-bit-a-cop-police-report-says\">according to an arrest report obtained by Fox News</a>.His lawless streak culminated last week when he allegedly entered a Los Angeles furniture store where Kupfer was working alone and stabbed her to death in broad daylight for no apparent reason.In January of 2021 Smith, 31 was arrested for vandalizing a stranger\u2019s car in Daly City, Calif., according to the report. He lashed out at arresting officers after an outburst in the back of a police cruiser,  the outlet said.\u201cI tried to speak to him, but he was just yelling over my words and not listening,\u201d officer Jay Mulitauopele reportedly wrote. \u201cThen Smith started yelling \u2018I\u2019ll kill you! I\u2019ll kill you!'\u201dThe suspect then started kicking the cruiser\u2019s door while screaming, prompting Mulitauopele and two other cops to take him out of the car and try to restrain him, the article said.\u201cHe moved his head quickly and bit my right index finger latching on with full force,\u201d Mulitauopele reportedly wrote. \u201cI screamed in pain.\u201dSmith\u2019s attack reportedly drew blood from Mulitauopele\u2019s finger and left it imprinted with teeth marks.Cops had responded to a restaurant after the suspect was accused of jumping on the hood of a worker\u2019s car, leaving a large dent that cost almost $4,000 to repair, the article said. Smith reportedly did not know the victim.His alleged rampage continued outside a nearby coffee shop, where Smith was accused of accosting two strangers sitting on a bench, stealing one of their phones and trying to fight them, according to the outlet. Smith \u2014 who was living in a San Francisco homeless shelter and was in possession of a loaded flare gun and knife \u2014 was charged with three felonies and was sentenced to 133 days in jail, the article stated. He subsequently ignored the terms of his probation, and a warrant was issued for his arrest late last year, according to the report.The South Carolina native had a modus operandi of attacking police officers and strangers, and had a rap sheet of at least 11 arrests in his home state, according to the article. Smith reportedly pleaded guilty to assaulting an officer after a 2016 arrest in Charleston. He had also been charged with firing a flare gun into a stranger\u2019s vehicle as a toddler sat in the back seat in 2019.Smith was freed on $50,000 bond in connection with the \u201croad rage incident\u201d but he was banned from leaving South Carolina under the conditions of his release, Fox News reported. It was unclear why California authorities did not contact Charleston jailors to revoke his bond and take him into custody after the Jan. 20 arrest outside of San Francisco. \u201cTypically the prosecutor\u2019s office in the sending state, in this case California, would notify the receiving state, in this case South Carolina, and the receiving state would tell them whether they intend to extradite,\u201d former Manhattan prosecutor Daniel Bibb told the outlet.Smith was arrested at a Pasadena bus stop Wednesday following a manhunt and a record-setting $250,000 reward for his capture, after the Jan. 13 murder of the Kupfer made national headlines.There was no known motive in connection with the <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2022/01/18/lapd-identifies-ucla-student-brianna-kupfers-murder-suspect/\">fatal stabbing</a> at the Croft House, a high-end furniture store in LA\u2019s Hancock Park neighborhood. Kupfer was working alone in the store and had texted a friend that a <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2022/01/18/murdered-ucla-grad-texted-friend-she-had-bad-vibe-about-man-in-store/\">customer was \u201cgiving her a bad vibe.\u201d</a>Smith did not steal anything, and had also entered other nearby businesses but quickly left because there were multiple people inside, detectives alleged.",

    "2022 - 7704": "President Biden called Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy a \u201cstupid son of a bitch\u201d Monday after he asked Biden about soaring inflation.\u201cDo you think inflation is a political liability?\u201d Doocy asked Biden as the press was ushered out of an event in the White House East Room.\u201cNo, it\u2019s a great asset \u2014\u00a0more inflation. What a stupid son of a bitch,\u201d Biden sneered into a hot mic.The president\u2019s vulgar insult was cut from the White House video feed but was audible on video streamed by C-SPAN.Doocy\u2019s question about inflation came after a Fox News poll released Sunday found that\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-poll-voters-reluctant-biden-second-term\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">85 percent\u00a0</a>of Americans are worried about inflation, which<a href=\"https://nypost.com/2022/01/12/inflation-hits-4-decade-high-consumer-prices-soar-7-percent/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\u00a0hit a 40-year high of 7 percent\u00a0</a>in December.When \u201cThe Five\u201d co-host Jesse Watters joked with Doocy shortly after Biden lost his temper, \u201cI think the president\u2019s right, you are a stupid SOB,\u201d the correspondent deadpanned, \u201cYeah nobody has fact-checked him yet and said it\u2019s not true.\u201dBut he defended his question on its merits moments later in a different TV appearance.In a remote setup with \u201cSpecial Report\u201d host Bret Baier, Doocy, the son of \u201cFox &amp; Friends\u201d morning host Steve Doocy, explained: \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to take any questions off-topic. He was at an event about inflation, and so I asked one on inflation.\u201dIt\u2019s rare for a president to call someone a \u201cson of a bitch\u201d \u2014 especially to their face. Former President Donald Trump drew sustained negative coverage in 2017 for using the term to refer to NFL players who refused to stand for the National Anthem to protest police brutality.Monday\u2019s outburst was the latest in a lengthy series of Biden jabs at the media.Just before Biden attacked Doocy, he chided a different reporter for asking him about fears that Russia may invade Ukraine \u2014 rather than about the gathering\u2019s stated focus on lowering prices.Biden bristled when a female reporter asked him about\u00a0<a href=\"https://nypost.com/2022/01/24/biden-to-phone-euro-allies-as-fears-of-russian-attack-on-ukraine-grow/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">his afternoon call with European allies</a>\u00a0to discuss possible Russian military action.\u201cThe only reason I don\u2019t like doing this is you never report on why I called the meeting. And this is really important. I had a very, very, very good meeting. Total unanimity with all the European leaders. We will talk about it later,\u201d Biden said.The president increasingly has attacked reporters for asking about subjects that he dislikes.On Thursday, Biden attacked a different Fox News reporter, Jacqui Heinrich, after she shouted, \u201cWhy are you waiting on [Russian President Vladimir] Putin to make the first move, sir?\u201d\u201cWhat a stupid question,\u201d\u00a0<a href=\"https://nypost.com/2022/01/20/biden-lashes-out-at-reporters-stupid-question-after-ukraine-gaffe/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Biden said</a>.Sen.

But I\u2019m going to answer your question because we\u2019ve known each other for so long.

What the hell? What do you do all of the time?

They didn\u2019t want to look at any of that.\u201d \u00a0Republicans are expected to make the \u201cdefund the police\u201d movement a focus of their messaging strategy this November as the party looks to take back the majority in both chambers of Congress.\u00a0\u201c[Americans are] rejecting this all across the board in states where you wouldn\u2019t think,\u201d Scalise told McDaniel. \u201cThe people of <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/11/03/minneapolis-voters-soundly-rejected-a-defund-ballot-initiative/\">Minneapolis voted against defunding the police</a> when the Democrat leaders wanted to defund the police.\u201cAnd so it shows you they\u2019re way out of touch, not only with mainstream America, they\u2019re out of touch with Democrat voters in a lot of these states,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd, you know, we\u2019re going to work to get it back. And we\u2019re not just going after Republican votes and independent votes, there are a lot of Democrats that are coming our way too because of this.\u201d\u00a0",
    "2022 - 3258": "An Asian American man beaten with a bat two years ago in San Francisco has sued city prosecutors over their alleged mishandling of what he says was a racially motivated attack.Anh L\u00ea, 69, alleged that he wasn\u2019t consulted by the San Francisco District Attorney\u2019s Office on a plea deal offered to a man who attacked him on Nov. 2, 2019 as he was walking through Chinatown, according to the lawsuit filed in federal court on Tuesday.\u201cThe San Francisco District Attorney\u2019s Office allowed the adult male attacker to plead to a misdemeanor with one-year probation, restitution to the victim and a criminal protective order,\u201d L\u00ea said at a press conference Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/Man-beaten-with-a-bat-in-S-F-s-Chinatown-sues-16803717.php\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the San Francisco Chronicle reported</a>.\u201cThey did this without consulting me, without any input from me at all, and in violation of my rights as a victim.\u201dIn his suit, he alleges that he was out for a walk when he nearly collided with a boy on a busy sidewalk outside a Chinatown market, the newspaper reported.To L\u00ea\u2019s shock, the boy allegedly grabbed a plastic baseball bat out of his mother\u2019s bag and hit L\u00ea repeatedly before his father, identified by authorities as Jimmy Tanner Sr., held up a glass bottle and threatened to kill L\u00ea, <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10443417/Asian-American-man-69-sues-SF-District-Attorney-not-prosecuting-attackers-hate-crime.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Daily Mail reported</a>.\u00a0The father and son were apprehended later that day.Tanner was detained on charges of battery, felony elder abuse and terroristic threats, the outlets reported.But prosecutors opted not to prosecute either Tanner or his son with a hate crime, and agreed to a plea deal with the father.\u00a0He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor battery offense and received a year of probation for the incident, the Daily Mail reported.\u00a0L\u00ea said he was never informed of the plea deal, nor the lack of intention to prosecute the attack as a hate crime. L\u00ea called the attack the \u201cmost brutal, terrifying and humiliating experience\u201d of his life during Tuesday\u2019s press conference.\u00a0He said he was never given the chance to enter a victim impact statement \u2014 so nothing was read at Tanner\u2019s plea deal hearing about the attack or the post-traumatic stress L\u00ea said he suffers now because of it. Rachel Marshall, a spokeswoman for the DA, said that District Attorney Chesa Boudin has been an \u201cadvocate\u201d for services and support for the Asian American and Pacific Islander community, including adding multilingual advocates to his office and launching the AAPI elder abuse steering committee.\u00a0While the attack on L\u00ea happened in 2019, targeted attacks against the AAPI community has <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2022/01/20/nyc-protesters-denounce-spike-in-anti-asian-violence-after-michelle-gos-death/\">surged nationwide</a> since the onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0On Tuesday, the San Francisco Police Department released statistics indicating 60 reported anti hate crimes reported citywide in 2021, up from nine in 2020 and eight in 2019. Authorities say one man is believed to be responsible for half of the 2021 attacks."
