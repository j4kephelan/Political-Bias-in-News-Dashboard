    "2006 - 4882": "This is the first look into the house of horrors where little Nixzmary Brown was found beaten to death, allegedly at the hands of her monster stepfather.   Cesar Rodriguez and wife Nixzaliz Santiago, both 27, slept soundly together each night in this comfy front room as their daughter often sat tightly bound to a beat-up school chair tied to a radiator in a bedroom at the back of the house.   No expense was spared on flashy stereo equipment, perfumes and soft toys for the parents in this Bed-Stuy apartment, even while Nixzmary was forced to eat cat food and use a litter box as a bathroom.   Unbelievably, one of Santiago\u2019s most cherished possessions is a certificate she displayed on top of the stereo \u2013 a certificate she earned after completing a child-care course in Connecticut while she was pregnant with Nixzmary.   In one room at the back, just feet to the rear of this one, Nixzmary\u2019s emaciated body was found.   Next to it sits the torture chamber in which police say Rodriguez dealt out his cruel punishments.   On a regular basis, sources say the pedophile predator would sexually assault and beat the girl and then tie her to the wooden chair, which was bound to the heater.   While a teddy bear wearing a heart that reads, \u201cI love you\u201d was the last thing Rodriguez and Santiago saw each night, Nixzmary allegedly used to fall asleep scared and bleeding, tied to her torture chair.   Investigators believe the stepdad and mom deliberately starved the little girl, who school social workers identified as a \u201ctarget\u201d in the household.   Rodriguez allegedly beat the 7-year-old in this apartment with his hands and belt because she tried to feed herself a yogurt after being the only sibling to be deprived of one.   He took her bruised body to a bathroom and banged her head against a faucet or a tile wall as he tried to plunge her in a bath of cold water, prosecutors say.   All the while, Nixzmary\u2019s mom allegedly sat feeding another baby, while her daughter pleaded \u201cMommy! Mommy!\u201d for two hours before she died.   Meanwhile, new horrifying details emerged yesterday about the brutal beatings the psychopath meted out to his eldest stepson.   Rodriguez regularly tied 9-year-old Javier to the same chair and taped his eyes shut.   In one horrific encounter, Rodriguez forced the little boy to consume his own waste and drink his own urine, sources told The Post.   The disgusting disclosure came in police interviews with the five other children living in the house and left veteran investigators sick to their stomachs.   \u201cIt was a real house of horrors,\u201d said one.   With every new detail, an even more sickening pattern of abuse has come to light \u2013 with the craven child abuser singling out his four stepchildren for vicious beatings, while he never laid a finger on his own two kids.   For the most minor transgressions \u2013 like taking food from the refrigerator or playing on his computer \u2013 Rodriguez would submit Javier and Nixzmary to the same brand of torture.   At one point, a neighbor recalled seeing a naked boy being dangled feet first out a window of the family\u2019s second-story apartment.   The neighbor said she screamed \u201cGet back inside!\u201d and the child crawled back in through the window.   The cycle of violence ended when Rodriguez fatally beat Brown to death on Wednesday night, police said.   He\u2019s charged with murder and sex abuse and could face additional charges. Nixzaliz Santiago is charged with manslaughter for doing nothing for two hours as her daughter lay dying.   Santiago has six children with four men \u2013 the last two, Augustine, 18 months, and Cesar Jr., 6 months, with Rodriguez.   The other children lived with Rodriguez as his stepchildren, relatives said.   Javier was born when Santiago was just 18, and was fathered by a man in her native Puerto Rico, whose name relatives would not disclose.   Nixzmary\u2019s father was a Pakistani man remembered by relatives only as Mian, who was only in Santiago\u2019s life for a short time. The tragic tot was born while Santiago was dating Edward John Brown, and he agreed for his name to be put on her birth certificate.   Santiago had two children with Brown, Edward Jr., 5, and Selena, 4.   While child-welfare officials admit they were aware that there was abuse in the house involving Brown, it is not clear if they knew that Rodriguez beat the other children.   Brown\u2019s death came despite a long paper trail at the Administration for Children\u2019s Services that detailed allegations of abuse.   At least a dozen calls had been made to the agency about the abuse. Caseworkers even visited the family\u2019s home and school officials desperately tried to get the girl help.   City officials have been up in arms over the case, and Mayor Bloomberg has vowed an investigation into the agency\u2019s handling of the case.

    "2006 - 5972": "Several child-welfare workers will be suspended as a result of the Administration for Children\u2019s Services\u2019 failure to prevent the cruel death of little Nixzmary Brown \u2013 and the agency itself is facing a shake-up, sources told The Post yesterday.   \u201cDisciplinary actions are coming,\u201d said one source, after a series of bungles led to the 7-year-old girl getting beaten to death, allegedly at the hands of her stepfather.   \u201cThere are [civil-service] rules. They [ACS brass] had to interview the caseworkers, supervisors and managers before they could take action.\u201d   The shake-up of the child-welfare agency could start as soon as this week, the source said.   Suspension is the first step in the disciplinary process, which could lead to punishments ranging from loss of pay and demotion to firing.   And the agency itself is going to be restructured to ensure that the most experienced personnel are more directly involved in keeping children safe.   \u201cThere\u2019s going to be an effort to make sure the right people are overseeing child protective cases,\u201d said one insider.   One of the most troubling aspects of the horrific case is that Nixzmary came into contact with four separate city-controlled bodies \u2013 Woodhull Hospital, the local public school, ACS and the Police Department \u2013 and none was able to save her.   Communication between city agencies was woeful \u2013 while school personnel were sounding grave alarms about the 7-year-old, their sense of urgency didn\u2019t seem to make an impact on ACS.   \u201cThey were on totally separate pages,\u201d said the official.   Caseworkers for ACS visited the girl\u2019s home six weeks before her death \u2013 but walked away from the alleged house of horrors saying in a report that \u201call the children\u2019s needs are being met by the parents.\u201d   The missed opportunity came just two days after a doctor at Woodhull apparently dropped the ball, stitching up a gash over the malnourished girl\u2019s eye and failing to note any possible signs of abuse, a city official said.   Another official said signs of abuse had been present for \u201ca considerable period of time,\u201d adding, \u201cif you saw the child, there were fresh ligature marks and there were at least two or three that were old and were healing.\u201d   News of the ACS housecleaning came as relatives, family friends and total strangers gathered for a powerfully emotional wake for Nixzmary \u2013 whose brutal death struck an emotional chord across the city.   Inside the R.G. Ortiz Funeral home on First Avenue in Manhattan, Nixzmary\u2019s battered body lay in a small white coffin, dressed in a beautiful white dress \u2013 and a veil and heavy makeup to cover her badly bruised face.   Maternal grandmother Maria Gonzalez pulled the veil back and kissed her granddaughter twice.   \u201cShe looks like an angel,\u201d she said.   Earlier, emotional relatives of Nixzmary\u2019s mom \u2013 Nixzaliz Santiago \u2013 tried to keep Iris Rodriguez, the sister of the little girl\u2019s accused stepfather, from seeing her niece.   She was finally allowed to gaze at the battered girl \u2013 but not to touch the coffin or the body.   Gonzalez\u2019s daughter, Nixzaliz Santiago, 27, stands charged with manslaughter for letting her daughter die as she lay for hours moaning \u201cMommy, Mommy\u201d after she was beaten.   Nixzmary\u2019s stepfather, Cesar Rodriguez, 27, is being held for her murder at Bellevue Hospital, where he is undergoing a psychiatric evaluation. Santiago is being held at Rikers Island.   Another great-aunt, Yolanda Lasalle, 36, of Harlem, said Nixzmary\u2019s death is helping to change the city.   \u201cI\u2019m glad her voice is finally being heard,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope her voice speaks loud and clear to the system, so these things don\u2019t happen again.\u201d   Outside, a sad but steady line of mourners stretched for two blocks in the freezing cold.   \u201cI never even knew the girl, but I had to come and say goodbye,\u201d said Aquilda Flores, 50, after viewing the body and paying her respects. \u201cTo me she looks like she\u2019s sleeping peacefully now.\u201d   Mayor Bloomberg, in a series of holiday appearances to honor the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., was greeted with applause when he conceded the city bore responsibility in Nixzmary\u2019s death.   \u201cIt was an act of incomprehensible violence [by her parents],\u201d the mayor declared at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.   \u201cI think it\u2019s also fair to say the blame rests with the city. People will be held accountable for their action in this tragedy.\u201d   The mayor described the protection of the young and vulnerable as \u201cone of the city\u2019s most sacred responsibilities.\u201d   Meanwhile, ACS released further details on the role of former supervisor Roger Moore, who resigned last week after it was determined that he altered records in the file of Dahquay Gillians, another child who died under ACS\u2019s care.   Moore, the supervisor on Nixzmary\u2019s case, claimed that the intense focus on the Gillians case diverted attention from the latest complaint involving the little girl, which came in Dec. 1.   But ACS officials countered that Moore hadn\u2019t actually worked at the agency since Dec. 9, the same day its general counsel confirmed he had doctored the Gillians case file.   \u201cSo he would have overseen Nixzmary\u2019s case from Dec. 1 through Dec. 9,\u201d said one official. Nixzmary died on Jan. 11, the same day Moore quit.   While mourners braved the cold to pay their respects at the wake, neighbors in Bed-Stuy shared their grief at the scene of the crime. Even as strong winds whipped a banner marking the spot where Nixzmary was beaten to death, candles placed there in her honor continued to burn.   \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d said neighbor Gwendolyn Turner of the makeshift memorial erected on Greene Avenue. \u201cIf we\u2019d only known.\u201d   Neighbor after neighbor, stranger after stranger, echoed the sad refrain, wishing there were more they could do than drop off pretty flowers or another plush teddy bear.

    "2006 - 6995": "A Bronx caseworker who goes knocking on the doors of parents accused of abusing or neglecting their kids says it\u2019s a losing battle to keep up with the work required to prevent another brutal murder like Nixzmary Brown\u2019s.   She now has a caseload of nearly 30 families whose kids could be at risk \u2013 about twice what the agency claims is the average \u2013 including seven new cases since Jan. 11, when Nixzmary, 7, was fatally beaten by her stepfather in their Bed-Stuy apartment.   The child-protective specialist with the city\u2019s embattled Administration for Children\u2019s Services and other workers interviewed by The Post said they struggle under staggering responsibilities. Some say they work long hours, but still can\u2019t keep on top of all the troubled families assigned to them.   \u201cI haven\u2019t seen half my families since the beginning of January,\u201d the young Bronx staffer admitted, saying caseworkers are expected to visit each family twice a month.   \u201cAny caseworker who says they have their work up to date, they\u2019re lying. It\u2019s impossible.   \u201cI like what I do, but it\u2019s getting overwhelming, and we don\u2019t have the tools to do the best we can. I feel like leaving.\u201d   She described the pressures and problems of a job so stressful, she said, some co-workers fake injuries to get time off or a desk job.   \u201cThat\u2019s the ideal thing \u2013 to get out of this, to get a 9-to-5 job where you get off at 5 p.m., and you don\u2019t have to worry about saving and protecting kids,\u201d she said, asking to remain anonymous to avoid repercussions.   A child-welfare specialist in the Jamaica, Queens, ACS office, Nicholas De Bello, voiced similar frustrations in an e-mail to co-workers last week, saying some child-protective staffers have caseloads \u201cwell into the thirties.\u201d   Since most families have multiple kids, he wrote, some workers are \u201cresponsible for the well-being of more than 100 children at a time.\u201d   And many kids are split between divorced or separated parents at opposite ends of a borough, making the logistics of checking up on them hellish.   \u201cFor me, morale is at an all-time low,\u201d De Bello wrote. He urges the agency to hire more workers, pay more \u2013 the average ACS caseworker makes about $39,000 \u2013 and give caseworkers police escorts for family visits at night in high-crime areas.   De Bello told The Post he stands by the work of his colleagues. \u201cEveryone busts their butts to do the best they can. I\u2019ve seen people cry over this,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is their lives.\u201d   His e-mail has spread like wildfire, sparking replies from colleagues \u2013 furious at what they call a \u201cmedia witch hunt\u201d \u2013 who thank him for speaking up about their plight.   A Queens caseworker fumed, \u201cThe public thinks that workers have a caseload of only 15, which as you know is absolutely false. People have been forging numbers, so those in administration believe that the caseloads are [low].\u201d   She complained that frontline workers who must rely on direction from higher-ups are being scapegoated. \u201cChange starts at the top, and it scares me that at any point I could lose my job because someone else made a decision or I was not properly advised on how to handle a case,\u201d she said.   The Bronx caseworker said supervisors are usually \u201cstrict\u201d about limiting overtime to make night visits, saying, \u201cIt can be done tomorrow,\u201d or to catch up on paperwork. But after Nixzmary\u2019s death, she said, ACS invited workers to come in Saturday, Sunday and Monday \u2013 the Martin Luther King holiday \u2013 and her office has remained open until 9 p.m. daily. An ACS spokeswoman confirmed the agency has \u201cloosened restrictions\u201d on overtime.   The Bronx staffer said she feels terrible for kids she often finds living in squalor with unstable or drug-addicted parents, but said: \u201cSometimes the families blur together. Sometimes you don\u2019t remember the kids\u2019 names, there are so many of them.\u201d   When a new abuse or neglect complaint comes in, she has 24 hours to contact the family. Since ACS provides no transportation, she takes the bus or subway, and the agency reimburses the fare.   School-attendance teachers sometimes claim they visited a kid with many absences at home, but give her a nonexistent address, she said. In other cases, she may start off a case with no address or a wrong one.   Then the buzzer may be broken, or a key needed to enter the gates. \u201cYou walk around until someone who lives in the building comes in or out,\u201d she said.   She raps on the door alone, armed only with her ACS badge.   What does ACS provide for protection? \u201cNothing,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just pray to God nothing happens.\u201d   The caseworker politely talks her way inside. She is often shocked and repulsed at the clutter and filth she finds \u2013 like dog feces on the floor.   \u201cSometimes they tell you everything \u2013 \u2018Yes, I just smoked crack yesterday,\u2019 or \u2018Yes, I smoked a little reefer.\u2019 \u201d   She then spells out the child-abuse complaint that came into a state hot line. \u201cThey\u2019re only allegations,\u201d she says. \u201cTell me what\u2019s true, and what\u2019s not true. Tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d   Some parents blurt out confessions, she said, like: \u201cYes, I did hit my kid, but he wasn\u2019t listening. I usually don\u2019t discipline like that, but I didn\u2019t use a belt or anything.\u201d   Even if the kid has a black eye, she said, the police rarely get involved.   \u201cSometimes we get reports that kids have marks and bruises, but there aren\u2019t arrests,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has to be excessive corporal punishment.\u201d   A caseworker has seven days to gauge the safety of every kid in the family \u2013 even if they live with parents or guardians in Staten Island or Queens. Is the kid in danger? If so, her supervisors decide what action to take, such as seeking a court order requiring the parents to get \u201cpreventive services,\u201d or to remove the child from the home.   Meanwhile, caseworkers may be summoned to testify on a custody issue and sit in court for \u201chours and hours\u201d waiting for the case to be called \u2013 and falling further behind.   The Bronx caseworker said she\u2019s \u201ctwo to three weeks behind\u201d on updating her file notes.   She dreads TV news on the death of a child, hoping it\u2019s not one of hers. When she heard about Nixzmary, she was horrified but relieved \u201cit wasn\u2019t my kid.\u201d   ACS spokeswoman Sharman Stein would not confirm the reported 30-plus caseloads, saying the citywide average in November was 14.6. She said the city plans to hire and train 525 new caseworkers this fiscal year.   But she conceded the job is so stressful that new hires leave in droves. ACS turnover is 25 percent a year, she said, but only slightly higher than the national average for child-welfare workers, about 22 percent.   \u201cAny caseworker who has a caseload that is too high to manage safely should immediately contact their supervisor and get help,\u201d she said.   The Bronx caseworker said she\u2019s complained to supervisors in the past that she was overburdened, but was told, \u201cEverybody is overwhelmed. Everybody has a high caseload. What do you want us to do?\u201d<em>susan.edelman@nypost.com</em> (p. 10 Metro)",
    "2006 - 2093": "A man who says he was beaten by two plainclothes cops who were not impressed by the fact that he\u2019s Police Commissioner Ray Kelly\u2019s cousin is suing the city for $1 million.   Arthur Heller, 27, claims the officers did not identify themselves as cops before they brutally assaulted him at a subway station on Jan. 11 as he repeatedly tried to swipe a malfunctioning MetroCard.   Heller, who also filed charges with the Civilian Complaint Review Board, says during the four hours he was held by cops he demanded to speak to his cousin, but was ignored.   Andrew Case of the CCRB said, \u201cThe fact that the person is or isn\u2019t a relative of Ray Kelly is not relevant to our investigation.   \u201cWe do not treat relatives of police officers differently from other people.\u201d   A notice of claim filed with the city comptroller\u2019s office alleges Heller was trying to get through a turnstile at about 9:45 a.m. at the station at the 43rd Street and 8th Avenue, when he was approached by two men wearing street clothes.   The men allegedly tackled and punched Heller even before identifying themselves as police officers.   Heller believes they had taken him for a fare-beater trying to steal a free ride with a mangled MetroCard.   Heller, who lives in upper Manhattan\u2019s Inwood section, claims to have been \u201cphysically abused, assaulted, beaten, battered, choked and battered with excessive force.\u201d   He was eventually let go without being charged.   There are four pictures of Heller\u2019s face attached to the claim demonstrating the beating he says he received.   More than 6,000 New Yorkers file formal complaints with the CCRB a year, according to Case.   Heller wouldn\u2019t return calls.   His lawyer Gabriel Levinson said only his client \u201cis content to let this play out through the courts.\u201d   Levinson did confirm reports that Heller\u2019s father, also named Arthur, is Ray Kelly\u2019s first cousin.   The NYPD would not comment on the Heller-Kelly relationship.   A spokesman for the city\u2019s Law Department said his agency has not received the legal papers on the case.<em>Additional reporting by Philip Messing</em>",
    "2006 - 2988": "A Long Island man who brutally beat his wife and chained her naked to a basement stairwell, while leopards roamed nearby, was sentenced to four years in jail yesterday for the vicious and bizarre attack.   After detailing the horrible suffering she endured at the hands of her husband, Anastasia Barone, 32, tearfully begged the judge yesterday to slap him with a five-year prison sentence.   Instead, Suffolk County Judge Robert Doyle sentenced Anthony Barone to four years in jail on weapons raps and charges including assault, unlawful imprisonment and endangering the welfare of a child.   In federal court, Barone pleaded guilty to animal possession and cruelty charges, which will run concurrent to the state convictions.   When law-enforcement officials responded to the Dix Hills home, they found a skinned Rottweiler \u2013 whose bones Barone was allegedly saving to boil for his collection \u2013 and a decaying lynx carcass sitting in an unplugged freezer, officials said.   Anastasia claimed the sentence doesn\u2019t do enough to protect her or her four children, ages 9, 8, 4 and 2.   \u201cThe week this defendant gets released from prison, he will hunt me down and kill me,\u201d Anastasia warned in a statement. \u201cI have begun to prepare for that day.\u201d   On May 20, 2005, Barone \u2013 who is obsessed with exotic animals, occult rituals and demonic paraphernalia \u2013 beat and abused his wife terribly.   \u201cHe kicked me straight in the face with a steel-toed boot, causing me to bleed profusely through my nose and mouth,\u201d Anastasia told the court. \u201cMy nose was broken and I could barely see.   \u201cThis time, I truly believed I would not survive the beating,\u201d she added.   As Anastasia slipped in and out of consciousness, Barone ordered her to undress completely. He then used a heavy-gauge chain to padlock her to a stairwell in their basement \u2013 as his pair of illegal 50-pound pet leopards prowled in the next room.   The strange crime continued as Barone chopped off most of his wife\u2019s hair with a hunting knife, ordered her into the family car, and drove her to Tony\u2019s Tattoos Ink, a tattoo parlor he owned in Lynbrook.   He wanted to finish a tattoo across the small of her back with his name on it to remind Anastasia that she was his property, prosecutors said.   Barone then forced Anastasia back into their home and kept her there against her will for nine days. Her aunt, who was also held at the house, escaped and alerted police.   Yesterday, Barone\u2019s family claimed that Anastasia bore some of the responsibility for what happened. Their attorney, James Saladino, said the case against his client has been \u201cgrossly exaggerated.\u201d   \u201cMrs. Barone has set out to vilify and create the image that he\u2019s a monster,\u201d Saladino said yesterday. \u201cBut it takes two to tango.\u201d   Saladino also claimed that by electing to plead guilty, instead of putting his children through a traumatic trial, Anthony Barone is the only person who has accepted responsibility in the sad tale.<em>devin.smith@nypost.com</em>",
    "2006 - 3451": "Cops charged the hotheaded teenage boyfriend of a Bronx mom with beating her 4-year-old son to death \u2013 and charged her for sitting by idly \u2013 as horrific new details emerged yesterday of the savage days-long brutality inflicted on the little boy.   Jos\u00e9 Calderon, 18, was charged with second-degree murder in the senseless beating of Quachaun Browne, who was found dead Monday from a fractured skull and other severe internal injuries, police said.   The battered boy\u2019s mother, Aleshia Smith, 26, was charged with second-degree manslaughter for not helping her son, police said. The couple was held pending arraignment late last night.   The abuse began last Thursday when a television crashed in the couple\u2019s vermin-infested Bronx apartment. Calderon blamed it on the boy and began punching him and slamming him into the apartment\u2019s walls, police sources said. This continued over the course of the next two days, the sources said.   On Saturday, the family went to a Chuck E. Cheese restaurant, where Quachaun began to vomit blood. The family returned home and Calderon beat the child again, the sources said.   By Sunday, the boy appeared severely ill, police said in citing admissions from the mother, and interviews with two older siblings who lived in the apartment.   It is believed the boy died sometime late that night. Early Monday, Smith told police she awoke to find Calderon trying to revive the child.   She told investigators she urged her boyfriend to let her call 911, but he said no, because he would get in trouble. At some point she managed to call police on a cellphone and paramedics arrived around 3:30 a.m., but the boy was already dead.   Calderon initially insisted to police that the boy\u2019s injuries came when a television fell on top of him, but later told investigators he lost his temper and hit the child, police sources said.   Police said there was evidence that Quachaun had injuries from earlier beatings and that the four other children living in the family\u2019s squalid Norwood apartment may have been beaten as well.   Quachaun Browne\u2019s gruesome end came despite the months-long involvement of the Administration for Children\u2019s Services with the family.   ACS caseworkers visited the family\u2019s home six times since Nov. 15, an ACS source said.   The most recent visit was Jan. 12. Three additional visits were made to MS 280, the school the siblings attended. Quachaun and the four other children were interviewed, the source said. The case files also indicated Smith attended a \u201cchild safety conference\u201d and had been receptive to agency efforts to help.   Caseworkers had no knowledge of Calderon, who neighbors said had moved in with Smith two months ago, the agency said.   ACS Commissioner John Mattingly said the overall case file should have prompted a \u201cstronger response,\u201d but insisted it does not suggest the agency \u201cfailed to act.\u201d<em>erika.martinez@nypost.com</em>  TIMELINE \u2013 CHRONOLOGY  JAN 26 \u2013 Thursday   A TV falls to the floor in the family\u2019s home.

Calderone initially insisted to police that the boy\u2019s injuries came when the TV fell on him. But he later admitted that he had lost his temper and hit the child, police sources said.   Police said there was evidence that Quachaun had injuries from earlier beatings and that the four other children living in the family\u2019s squalid Norwood apartment may have been beaten, as well.   Quachaun\u2019s gruesome end came despite the months-long involvement of the Administration for Children\u2019s Services.   ACS caseworkers had visited the family\u2019s home six times since Nov. 15, an agency source said.   The most recent visit was Jan. 12. Three additional visits were made to MS 280, the school the siblings attended. Quachaun and the four other children were interviewed, the source said.   Caseworkers had no knowledge of Calderone, the agency said.   Neighbors said Calderone \u2013 who had been busted just two weeks ago for allegedly driving a stolen car \u2013 had been living with Smith since August.   ACS Commissioner John Mattingly said the overall case file should have prompted a \u201cstronger response,\u201d but insisted it does not suggest the agency \u201cfailed to act.\u201d<em>erika.martinez@nypost.com</em>  TIMELINE \u2013 CHRONOLOGY  JAN 26 \u2013 Thursday   A TV falls to the floor in the family\u2019s home.

    "2006 - 1078": "A brutal knife-wielding rapist (right) who confronts his terrified victims while wearing a red and white devil mask has been terrorizing women in Brooklyn, police said yesterday.   The pervert has attacked three women along Bushwick Avenue between the Williamsburg and the Bushwick housing projects since October.   The most recent attack was Tuesday.   The masked man drags his victims into secluded areas and threatens their lives before assaulting and robbing them.   The women were able to get glimpses of the creep, and police released a sketch of him yesterday.   He is described as about 30 years old, 6 feet tall, with short, dark hair and a goatee.   During some of the attacks the rapist has worn the eerie, plastic mask.   He also wears a waist-length, dark jacket and brown boots, with a brown bandanna or a black hooded jacket with red or orange writing on it.   The victims all were treated at area hospitals and released in stable condition, police said.   Anyone with information should call Crime Stoppers at (800) 577-TIPS. All calls will be kept confidential."
