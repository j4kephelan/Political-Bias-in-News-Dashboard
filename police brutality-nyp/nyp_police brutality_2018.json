    "2018 - 4911": "President Trump declared \u201ca new American moment\u201d in his first State of the Union address Tuesday \u2014 touting his tax cuts and the booming US economy and vowing to work with Democrats to reform the nation\u2019s immigration policies and crumbling infrastructure.\u201cTonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people,\u201d Trump said to Congress and the nation at the Capitol. \u201cThis in fact is our new American moment. There has never been a better time to start living the American dream.\u201dThe speech, which went for 80 minutes, had some 150 applause lines, including when Trump said \u201cthe state of our union is strong because our people are strong.\u201dThe president focused on many of the same themes on which he campaigned \u2014 keeping Americans safe, cutting regulations and stimulating the fossil fuel industry \u2014 but also struck a conciliatory tone.\u201cTogether, we are building a safe, strong and proud America,\u201d he said.The president spoke proudly of the GOP tax cut plan passed by Congress \u2014 boasting that 3 million American workers had \u00adalready received employer bonuses.\u201cOur massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small businesses,\u201d he said, reading from a teleprompter and largely sticking to his prepared remarks. \u201cSince we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses \u2014 many of them thousands of dollars per worker.\u201dAnd after a hyperpartisan year in Washington \u2014 during which the president launched myriad Twitter attacks against his critics \u2014 he stressed unity.\u201cTonight, I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have, and what kind of nation we are going to be. All of us, together, as one team, one people, and one American family can do anything. We all share the same home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great American flag,\u201d he said.But he also revived his divisive beef with <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/01/30/trump-calls-for-americans-to-stand-for-national-anthem/\">NFL players who kneel for the national anthem to protest police brutality</a> \u2014 after he introduced Preston Sharp, a 12-year-old California boy who ran a program to place American flags on veterans\u2019 graves.\u201cPreston\u2019s reverence for those who have served our nation reminds us why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national anthem,\u201d Trump said.The president at several points returned to his handling of the economy, and spoke again about repairing the nation\u2019s infrastructure \u2014 a key campaign promise he has yet to fulfill.\u201cIn our drive to make Washington accountable, we have eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration in history. We have ended the war on American energy \u2014 and we have ended the war on beautiful clean coal,\u201d he said.Trump also pushed for <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/01/30/trump-backs-law-to-allow-experimental-treatments/\">terminally ill Americans to be able to use experimental drugs.</a>\u201cPeople who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure \u2014 I want to give them a chance right here at home. It is time for the Congress to give these wonderful Americans the right to try,\u201d he said.The president also urged a bipartisan solution to the contentious debate on immigration.\u201cStruggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American workers and American families,\u201d Trump declared. \u201cSo tonight I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties, Democrats and Republicans, to protect our citizens of every background, color, and creed.\u201dBut he said that American citizens must come first, \u201cbecause Americans are dreamers, too,\u201d a reference to the foreign-born Dreamers protected from deportation by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.<a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/01/30/trump-booed-over-chain-migration-comments-at-state-of-the-union/\">Then, when Trump talked about ending chain migration</a> \u2014 which gives preference to extended families of immigrants already in the US \u2014 Democrats in the audience booed.First lady <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/01/30/melania-arrives-at-state-of-the-union-without-trump/\">Melania Trump arrived separately from the president</a>, her first public appearance with her husband since allegations surfaced that he had an affair with porn vixen Stormy Daniels, a charge she and the White House deny.Some Democrats, including New York Rep. Gregory Meeks and Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, boycotted the speech, with Lewis bitterly criticizing the president for his reference to some African nations as \u201cs\u2013thole countries.\u201d\u201cAt every opportunity, he\u2019s disrespected me and individuals who look like me. I cannot respect him,\u201d Meeks told MSNBC.",

Two other children were found in the home unharmed, the mayor said.The woman said she was attacked as she returned home, but investigators don\u2019t know exactly when that was or where she had gone, Tecklenburg said.Investigators have not found any connection between Evans and the girl\u2019s family and they haven\u2019t figured out a motive for the kidnapping, the mayor said.Authorities said Heidi\u2019s dad was on a plane to reunite with his daughter in Riverside, Alabama, about 35 miles east of Birmingham, authorities said.\u201cI saw a picture of her with a happy, smiling face,\u201d Tecklenburg said.The girl\u2019s mother remains in the hospital and underwent surgery Wednesday, the mayor said.Authorities spent the past 24 hours looking for the girl, searching nearby ponds and flying over Charleston in helicopters.

However, there is no specific state official responsible for ensuring that happens when students are transferred between districts or taken from a public school to a private or charter school.The New Mexico Public Education Department tracks dropout rates and other statistics, but does not follow up when students vanish from the education system, spokeswoman Lida Alikhani said in an email.\u201cThe state is not required to intervene with any individual student,\u201d she said. \u201cThat responsibility lies on the school or district.\u201dIn Valencia\u2019s case, West Las Vegas Middle School officials believed the teen had been transferred to Capshaw Middle School because a code showed that he was a student there, said Christopher Gutierrez, the superintendent for the Las Vegas district.Records show a preliminary registration form had been filled out for Valencia, but he never became a student, said Jeff Gephart, a spokesman for Santa Fe Public Schools.Gutierrez told The New Mexican that staff members did their due diligence when they tried to follow up on Valencia, but said he has implemented changes following his death.\u201cSome of the things I see (are) that we need to communicate a little more,\u201d Gutierrez said. \u201cDifferent people have different roles to play when it comes to transferring (records) or accepting transfer slips.

    "2018 - 7411": "Sergei Skripal escaped Russia \u2014 but knew he could never outrun the Kremlin.The former Russian army officer-turned-British double agent\u2019s life changed instantly in 2010 when he was plucked from a brutal penal colony where he was serving time for treason and flown to the UK in the high-profile prisoner swap that saw <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2014/12/07/sexy-russian-spy-tried-to-seduce-snowden/\">sexy spy Anna Chapman</a>, who had been living in New York, deported to Russia.Skripal left a punishing existence behind bars under Vladimir Putin\u2019s thumb for a comfy retirement, and lived the next seven years in a sleepy English town on a government pension.But he could never stop looking over his shoulder, according to family members.\u201cFrom the first days, he knew that it could end badly and that he would not be left alone,\u201d an anonymous relative told BBC Russia.On Sunday, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/03/05/ex-russian-spy-critically-ill-after-exposure-to-unknown-substance/\">Skripal\u2019s past may have finally caught up with him</a>, when he and his <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/03/06/woman-found-unconscious-with-ex-russian-spy-is-his-daughter/\">daughter, 33-year-old Yulia, suddenly collapsed on a bench</a> outside a local shopping mall \u2014 after exposure to what authorities say was an \u201cunknown substance.\u201dAdding to the intrigue, Skripal\u2019s wife, son and brother have all passed away over the past five years \u2014 and family members remain suspicious about the circumstances, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43297638\">according to the BBC</a>.His wife, Lyudmila, reportedly died of cancer in the UK in 2012, his older brother passed away in Russia two years later, and his son, Alexandr, died of liver failure last year while on holiday in the Russian city of St. Petersburg.On Tuesday, Skripal and Yulia were fighting for their lives in a hospital while British authorities scrambled to figure out how they fell ill \u2014 and whether Moscow was finally exacting revenge for the military officer\u2019s betrayal.The parallels to the 2006 assassination of defected Russian agent Alexander Litvinenko \u2014 who was <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2016/01/22/how-putin-probably-had-ex-kgb-spy-killed-with-tea-and-honey/\">poisoned with radioactive tea in London</a>, likely on the orders of Putin himself, an inquiry recently found \u2014 have not gone unnoticed by Britain\u2019s leaders.The case is so \u201cunusual,\u201d Scotland Yard said Tuesday, that it is placing its counterterrorism police in charge of the investigation \u2014 while UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson threatened \u201crobust\u201d retaliation if the Kremlin is found to have any connection to Skripal\u2019s illness.\u201cShould evidence emerge that implies state responsibility, then Her Majesty\u2019s government will respond appropriately and robustly,\u201d he told Parliament, adding that such a response could include boycotting the upcoming soccer World Cup in Russia.\u201cI think we will have to have a serious conversation about our engagement with Russia, and for my own part, I think it will be very difficult to see how we can,\u201d Johnson said.A Kremlin spokesman called it a \u201ctragic situation\u201d but denied any knowledge of the incident in Moscow.But Putin himself declared amid the 2010 prisoner swap that \u201ctraitors always end badly.\u201d\u201cSecret services live by their own laws and these laws are very well known to anyone who works for a secret service,\u201d the former KGB officer said ominously at the time.An elaborate poisoning plot would certainly be a fitting climax for a man whose life story reads like a Cold War thriller.A decorated former military man, Skripal was working for Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry when he was arrested in 2004 \u2014 after authorities say he was caught leaking information about Russian military spies to the UK via a James Bond-style transmitter hidden inside a rock in a Moscow park, the Daily Mail reported.They say he was paid more than $100,000 for the intel.Skripal was sentenced to 13 years behind bars, and served time in one of Mordovia\u2019s notoriously tough prisons until 2010 \u2014 when he and three others were exchanged for 10 members of a Russian sleeper cell that had been uncovered in the United States.Among the spy ring\u2019s ranks was Chapman, the flame-haired daughter of a Russian diplomat who was working as a real estate agent in New York \u2014 and has since parlayed her notoriety and bombshell looks into a post-espionage career as a media personality.Skripal, however, settled into a quiet, low-key life in the small city of Salisbury with Lyudmila and Yulia. He bought a red-brick house and a BMW, liked to play the lottery and recently joined a social club, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/06/salisbury-scratchcards-and-sausage-the-quiet-life-of-sergei-skripal\">the Guardian reports</a>.\u201cHe said hello if he walked past, and seemed like a nice chap,\u201d neighbor James Puttock told the paper. \u201cWhen he moved in, he invited us all over for a housewarming party; I imagine he invited the whole street.\u201dWhen Lyudmila died in 2012, Yulia reported her passing to the local authorities and described her father as a former government planning officer, according to the paper.Yulia, who had worked for Nike in Russia before the 2010 move, was employed at a Holiday Inn in England as recently as 2014, but more recently seems to have moved back to Moscow, where she works for PepsiCo Russia, according to her Facebook page.But she regularly visits her dad in Salisbury, photos on the page suggest, and their housekeeper told the Guardian she was on one such trip when the pair were suddenly afflicted with a mystery illness in the middle of town on Sunday afternoon.\u201cShe was slumped over on the man\u2019s shoulder,\u201d Freya Church, 27, who found the pair on a bench, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/03/06/first-picture-daughter-poisoned-russian-spy-fighting-life-hospital/\">told the Telegraph</a>.\u201cTo be honest, I thought they might be homeless but they were perhaps better dressed,\u201d Church said. \u201cShe had a red bag at her feet. He was gesturing at the sky, doing some kind of movements with his hands .\u2009.\u2009. He was looking up and his eyes were glazed.\u201dInvestigators in anti-contamination suits later sealed off the site and several nearby businesses \u2014 including two restaurants.On Tuesday night, cops were still outside the eateries \u2014 Italian chain Zizzi and pub The Mill \u2014 and were preparing to go inside, according to local paper the Salisbury Journal.Meanwhile, radiation and toxicology experts have been tapped to help work out exactly what the Skripals have been exposed to.Nothing untoward appears to have happened to the other three Russians swapped alongside Skripal \u2014 Igor Sutyagin, Aleksandr Zaporozhsky and Gennady Vasilenko.\u201cI am not concerned,\u201d Sutyagin <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/sergei-skripal-informer-slipped-away-after-spy-swap-for-russian-femme-fatale-anna-chapman-r6fpjczcl\">told the Times of London</a>, adding that he\u2019s not sure Russia is to blame. \u201cThere are lots of former security officers that deserted to the West.\u201dBut Marina Litvinenko, the widow of assassinated spy Alexander Litvinenko, says the whole situation feels suspiciously familiar to her.\u201cIt\u2019s like deja vu, [like] what happened to me 11 years ago,\u201d she told BBC Radio.\u201cIn Russia it is still [an] old-fashioned and old-style KGB system,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s still all the same.

They entered Alford pleas to the charges in August in which they acknowledged prosecutors had enough evidence for convictions but admitted no guilt.The Nachitgals were arrested in February 2016 after an 11-year-old boy was found walking barefoot in a field and told authorities he feared returning home because he hadn\u2019t done his homework and that was a sin. The boy\u2019s 11-year-old sister was found with a broken leg.The couple had adopted the children from an area of Peru where they worked as missionaries.North Newton Police Chief Randy Jordan wiped back tears as he described what he saw when he was called to the Nachtigal\u2019s home and the injuries to the boy,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.ksn.com/news/local/north-newton-couple-sentenced-in-horiffic-case-of-abuse-involving-adopted-children/1021980097\">KSNW</a>\u00a0reported.\u201cThey did find there was a healing broken bone in his arm, and when he said he got hit it hurt, he got hit hard,\u201d Jordan said. The police chief previously said the Department for Children and Families received around a dozen reports from people concerned about the couple\u2019s treatment of their adoptive children \u2014 some coming as early as 2014 \u2014 but none were forwarded to his department for investigation.The eldest of the adopted children escaped the brunt of the abuse and read a prepared statement during the sentencing in which she described the younger children being beaten with a cane and a wooden spoon. The girl, now 17, also said her adopted siblings were deprived of food and even a real bed.Jim and Paige Nachtigal, who will begin their sentences next week, both spoke during the hearing.\u201cI had no idea of the difficulties and behaviors I would have to deal with,\u201d said Paige Nachtigal. Jim Nachtigal was fired from his job as CEO of the Kansas Christian Home, an elderly care facility, after charges were filed.Harvey County Attorney David Yoder told The Wichita Eagle after the hearing that the boy was adopted by his foster family and that the older girl is doing well in high school. He said the younger girl is \u201cseverely traumatized\u201d and in a group home.\u201cHer recovery is going to take a lot longer,\u201d Yoder said."
