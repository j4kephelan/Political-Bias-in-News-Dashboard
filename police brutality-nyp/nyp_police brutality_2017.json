    "2017 - 4989": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A day after self-described anarchists created chaos, thousands of women are descending upon Washington for what is expected to be a more orderly show of force on the first full day of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.Organizers of Saturday\u2019s Women\u2019s March on Washington expect more than 200,000 people to attend their gathering, a number that could rival Trump\u2019s swearing-in ceremony. Attendees are \u201churting and scared\u201d as the new president takes office and want a greater voice for women in political life, according to the organizers\u2019 mission statement.\u201cIn the spirit of democracy and honoring the champions of human rights, dignity, and justice who have come before us, we join in diversity to show our presence in numbers too great to ignore,\u201d the statement says.Women and other groups were demonstrating across the nation and as far abroad as Myanmar and Australia.In Sydney, thousands of Australians marched in solidarity in the city\u2019s central Hyde Park. One organizer said hatred, bigotry and racism are not only America\u2019s problems.The Washington gathering, which features a morning rally and afternoon march, comes a day after protesters set fires and hurled bricks in a series of clashes that led to more than 200 arrests. Police used pepper spray and stun grenades to prevent the chaos from spilling into Trump\u2019s formal procession and evening balls.About a mile from the National Mall, police gave chase to a group of about 100 protesters who smashed the windows of downtown businesses including a Starbucks, a Bank of America and a McDonald\u2019s as they denounced capitalism and Trump.\u201cThey began to destroy property, throw objects at people, through windows. A large percentage of this small group was armed with crowbars and hammers,\u201d said the city\u2019s interim police chief, Peter Newsham.Six officers suffered minor injuries, he said.The confrontation began an hour before Trump took the oath of office and escalated several hours later as the crowd of protesters swelled to more than 1,000, some wearing gas masks and with arms chained together inside PVC pipe. One said the demonstrators were \u201cbringing in the cavalry.\u201dWhen some crossed police lines, taunting, \u201cPut the pigs in the ground,\u201d police charged with batons and pepper spray, as well as stun grenades, which are used to shock and disperse crowds. Booms echoed through the streets about six blocks from where Trump would soon hold his inaugural parade.Some protesters picked up bricks and concrete from the sidewalk and hurled them at police lines. Some rolled large, metal trash cans at police. Later, they set fire to a limousine on the perimeter of the secured zone, sending black smoke billowing into the sky during Trump\u2019s procession.As night fell, protesters set a bonfire blocks from the White House and frightened well-dressed Trump supporters as they ventured to the new president\u2019s inaugural balls. Police briefly ordered ball goers to remain inside their hotel as they worked to contain advancing protesters.Police said they charged 217 people with rioting, said Newsham, noting that the group caused \u201csignificant damage\u201d along a number of blocks.Before Inauguration Day, the DisruptJ20 coalition, named after the date of the inauguration, had promised that people participating in its actions in Washington would attempt to shut down the celebrations, risking arrest when necessary.It was unclear whether the groups will be active on Saturday.The Women\u2019s March on Washington features a morning rally with a speaking lineup that includes a series of celebrities, Scarlett Johansson, America Ferrara, Amy Schumer, Frances McDormand and Zendaya, among them.Christopher Geldart, the District of Columbia\u2019s homeland security director, said he expects the march to draw more than 200,000. He said 1,800 buses have registered to park in the city on Jan. 21, which would mean nearly 100,000 people coming in just by bus.Friday\u2019s protests spread across the nation. In San Francisco, thousands formed a human chain on the Golden Gate Bridge and chanted \u201cLove Trumps hate.\u201d In the city\u2019s financial district, a few hundred protesters blocked traffic outside an office building partly owned by Trump.In Atlanta, protests converged at City Hall and a few hundred people chanted and waved signs protesting Trump, denouncing racism and police brutality and expressing support for immigrants, Muslims and the Black Lives Matter movement.In Nashville, half a dozen protesters chained themselves to the doors of the Tennessee Capitol. Hundreds also sat in a 10-minute silent protest at a park while Trump took the oath of office. Organizers led a prayer, sang patriotic songs and read the Declaration of Independence aloud.In the Pacific Northwest, demonstrators in Portland, Oregon, burned U.S. flags and students at Portland State University walked out of classes. About 200 protesters gathered on the Capitol steps in Olympia, Washington, carrying signs that included the messages \u201cResist Trump\u201d and \u201cNot My Problem.\u201d",
    "2017 - 6544": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 Businesses around the world bearing US President Donald Trump\u2019s name face an increased risk now that he is in the White House, security experts warn, especially as several are in areas previously targeted by violence.As Trump remains a brand overseas, criminal gangs or militants could target buildings bearing his name in gold, abduct workers associated with his enterprises for ransom or worse, they say.\u201cThey may kidnap a Trump worker and not even want to negotiate,\u201d aiming for publicity instead, said Colin P. Clarke, a political scientist with the RAND Corporation who studies terrorism and international criminal networks.Predicting an attack keeps police, intelligence agencies and security experts awake at night around the world \u2014 and, by its very nature, it remains speculative.US brands have been targeted in overseas violence before, but they never belonged to a president. That\u2019s the difference. Trump becoming America\u2019s 45th president presents a unique challenge given the range of his international business interests.Asked about security issues, the Trump Organization said in a statement it has \u201cextensive protocols in place at our Trump-owned and -managed properties\u201d in the United States and abroad.\u201cOur team continues to work very closely with local law enforcement,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe are also working in tandem with the local developers at Trump-branded properties worldwide to ensure that all residents, guests and associates remain safe and secure.\u201d The organization did not elaborate.While Trump has said he will put his business assets in a trust and hand over management control of his company to his two adult sons and a longtime Trump Organization executive, it\u2019s still his name on the projects.That hasn\u2019t worried Kim Ok Kyu, who lives in a Trump-branded apartment tower in Seoul, South Korea. She said security at her building is quite good, with many guards and strict restrictions on outsiders entering the building\u201cTerror? I don\u2019t think about it. I just hope my home prices go up,\u201d Kim said.But other properties are in areas that have seen violence, like Trump Towers Istanbul, the Turkish city hit hard by a string of bomb and gun attacks carried out by the Islamic State group. Flags and banners around the site bear the president\u2019s name, while private security guards man X-ray machines and metal detectors at its entrances, a standard practice in the city.In Bali, where bombs planted by the Islamic extremist group Jemaah Islamiyah targeting bar-goers killed 202 people in 2002, Trump\u2019s organization has licensed the president\u2019s name to a planned luxury resort. Bali police spokesman Hengky Widjaja said no one had requested extra security for the property and authorities had no plans to increase their presence there.A Trump-named residential tower is under construction in the Indian city of Mumbai, which was hit by a 2008 terror attack blamed on the Pakistani militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba that killed 166 people. Mumbai police spokesman Ashok Dudhe said he had no knowledge of any additional security around the tower.Another tower is being built in Manila in the Philippines, a nation where Abu Sayyaf militants conduct frequent kidnappings for ransom and where President Rodrigo Duterte wages a brutal crackdown on drug dealers that has killed thousands. Philippine police say they haven\u2019t monitored any specific threat toward Trump properties, though a tower rising in Manila sits in an area under an intensified security watch after Duterte declared a \u201cstate of lawlessness\u201d following a September bombing.Even Trump\u2019s soon-to-open golf course in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates could be a target, despite the fact the Gulf Arab nation has largely escaped the violence gripping its Mideast neighbors. In the UAE\u2019s capital of Abu Dhabi, an American school teacher was stabbed to death in a mall bathroom by an extremist in December 2014. Authorities also have imprisoned others over disrupted terror plots in the country, which hosts some 5,000 members of the US military.Dubai police have declined to discuss safety on the golf course while the developer says it plans no additional security there. The US Embassy in Abu Dhabi did not respond to questions about the golf course, which Trump\u2019s children are expected to soon visit.All of the Trump properties should be looked at by outside security consultants, said Christopher A. Hagon, a managing partner of The Incident Management Group and a former London police officer with experience in diplomatic security. However, he acknowledged such commercial properties can\u2019t be surrounded by concrete blast walls and controlled like a US Embassy.\u201cThere is no complete answer to these things unless you\u2019ve got a military encampment and you can do anything you like,\u201d Hagon said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make compromises, but hope those compromises won\u2019t weaken the overall approach.\u201dAway from the properties themselves, employees could be threatened, robbed or held captive, experts warn. Under US law, the Secret Service is authorized to protect the president, the vice president and their immediate families. That would include his sons Eric and Donald Jr., who will run the Trump Organization under the plan announced by the president at a news conference last week.Already, the Secret Service and the New York police have provided security in and around Trump Tower in Manhattan as the president lives and works there.When asked about the Trump Organization, Secret Service spokeswoman Cathy Milhoan said the agency does \u201cnot comment on our protective operations.\u201d However, that Secret Service protection extends anywhere the president and his immediate family travels.The US intelligence community already has a duty to warn American citizens and others if it uncovers information about impending threats, which would include Trump\u2019s businesses.In 2015, National Intelligence Director James Clapper set formal guidelines for how the intelligence community does that if it learns of impending threats of killing, serious bodily harm or kidnapping.\u201cThis includes threats where the target is an institution, place of business, structure or location,\u201d according to Clapper\u2019s directive.Those threats become more serious if Trump\u2019s work intersects with his duties in the Oval Office and a militant group decides to \u201cmock, torment or tease\u201d him with a kidnapped employee, Clarke said.He added: \u201cIf an executive from Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan or ExxonMobil gets kidnapped, it\u2019s news, but it\u2019s not the president\u2019s company.\u201d",
    "2017 - 5513": "A man obsessed with Jack the Ripper strangled and stabbed a blond mother of two before scrawling the word \u201cJack\u201d on her dead body, a court has heard.Casey Scott took a photograph of his naked victim as \u201ca morbid trophy,\u201d leaving her body on the bathroom floor of his studio apartment \u2014 with the 29-year-old man now jailed for a minimum of 19 years.The court heard Scott had booked Lenuta Haidemac, 28, for a $187-an-hour sex session before brutally killing her with a 10-centimeter (4-inch) blade and leaving her \u201cdegraded\u201d body in his apartment in Skegness, Lincolnshire, on the east coast of England.Having researched the notorious serial killer Jack the Ripper around the time he killed her, Scott then fled \u2014 going on the run for three days before being tracked down by cops.Judge Michael Heath slammed the \u201cbrutal\u201d murder as he jailed Scott for almost two decades during the hearing at Lincoln Crown Court, saying the man had committed an \u201cevil act.\u201dProsecutor Sarah Knight said Haidemac had been \u201cvulnerable,\u201d with the woman lured to the home by Scott, who had no intention to pay her.\u201cOnce inside his flat, sexual activity having taken place between them, he strangled her and subjected her to a violent knife attack,\u201d Knight said.\u201cHe then degraded her naked dead body still further by scrawling the word \u2018Jack\u2019 across her abdomen, a morbid reference to his internet search concerning Jack the Ripper.\u201cKnowing what he had done, he then went to ground, trying to escape justice before the police were able to track him down.\u201dHaidemac was Romanian and lived 20 miles away in Boston with her partner, Octavian Selistean, and their two sons, then ages 3 and 13.Working as an escort, Haidemac had advertised her services online, where Scott tracked her down and arranged to meet her in July, with the man buying four cans of lager, chocolate and biscuits just before Haidemac\u2019s partner drove her to the meeting.Selistean waited to hear from the young woman to make sure she had arrived safely at the ground-floor apartment \u2014 receiving a text message at 10:32 p.m.He never heard from her again, and alerted police the next day.Knight said: \u201cShe was never to be heard or seen alive after that time by anyone other than Scott.\u201dPolice searched the home after Selistean\u2019s call, finding a used condom that matched Haidemac\u2019s DNA with indications that the pair had sex on the double bed.Knight said: \u201cOn the pillow was found a bloodstained knife and in the shower room they found the body of Lenuta Haidemac on the floor. She was already dead and cold to touch, indicating she had been dead for some time. She was naked and partly covered by a duvet. She was lying on her back.\u201dThe court heard that she had been strangled and stabbed twice in the neck, with lines across her throat and two puncture wounds beneath her nipples.The court heard Scott left behind his mobile phone when he fled.Knight added: \u201cUpon analysis a thumbnail image was found on it showing that he must have taken a picture depicting the victim\u2019s dead body as she lay on his bathroom floor, as if to record the event as some sort of keepsake or trophy of what he had achieved.\u201cFrom checks of Scott\u2019s internet activity at around the time of Lenuta\u2019s death, it appears that he had been researching the notorious murderer Jack the Ripper on the internet.\u201dScott eventually was arrested 20 miles from the murder scene after being found in a hedgerow in a disused area of Boston.The court heard Scott had no previous convictions and only one caution for shoplifting in 2009, but following the murder, police traced two other young women whom Scott had attempted to strangle.On the day of the murder, Scott also sent a Facebook message to a friend about a prostitute coming over. When the pal warned Scott he would not get away without paying, Scott messaged back: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019ll sort it.\u201dDefense lawyer Andrew Jefferies said that while it was accepted that Scott had \u201cdegraded\u201d Haidemac\u2019s body, there was no evidence he had researched Jack the Ripper until after the killing.\u201cThe killing appears to have happened at the time she was to leave, 11:30 p.m.,\u201d Jefferies told the court.\u201cThe search for Jack the Ripper on the internet was not until 11.49 p.m. and the photo a minute later.\u201dAt an earlier hearing, Scott, who had lived in the apartment five years, admitted murdering Haidemac last July.Passing a life sentence on Scott, Heath ordered him to serve a minimum of 19 years\u2019 imprisonment before he can be considered for release by the parole board.Heath told Scott, who appeared in court by video link from prison, that it was a \u201cbrutal\u201d murder.\u201cHer life was brutally ended by you, by strangulation and a vicious knife attack, followed by the degradation of her body.\u201cYour evil act left Ms. Haidemac dead and deprived two young children of their mother.\u201dThe judge added that the killing was aggravated by Scott\u2019s behavior afterward: \u201cYou took a photograph of her naked body as some kind of morbid keepsake or trophy of what you had done.\u201dHaidemac\u2019s partner and two children returned to Romania after the murder.In a victim statement, Selistean said: \u201cShe did not deserve this, she must have been so frightened at the end.\u201dSpeaking after the hearing, Detective Chief Inspector Diane Coulson, who investigated the murder, said: \u201cScott is clearly a dangerous individual and he is now off the streets for 19 years.\u201cBut it will be very difficult for Lenuta\u2019s partner and her children to come to terms with. They have lost part of their family.\u201d",

    "2017 - 3443": "Cold case detectives nabbed a wealthy British businessman who raped a woman at knifepoint 26 years ago after he got in a fight with rowdy teens outside his home decades later.Mark Carnelley attacked the 25-year-old woman in 1990 in a busy shopping center but police weren\u2019t able to solve the case until they obtained a DNA sample.Carnelley, now 52, was forced to give a sample in 2010 after he was accused of assaulting a teenager while confronting a gang of rowdy youths outside his five-bedroom house.But it took another five years for detectives to pin the rape on him after Nottinghamshire police carried out a review of unsolved crimes in 2015.DNA samples on the victim\u2019s clothes were taken and provided a match with Carnelley when they were put in the national police database.The businessman was finally put behind bars yesterday for seven years after admitting rape at Nottingham Crown Court.He also was ordered to be listed in the Sex Offenders\u2019 Register indefinitely.Judge Stuart Rafferty QC said: \u201cAt the age of 26, you did something absolutely unforgivable. As the time went by, you simply confined her and that night to memory.\u201cWere it not for advances in science you would never have been caught.\u00a0Thank heavens sometimes for science.\u201dThe court heard how Carnelley, who ran a successful printing firm, bundled the woman into an alleyway in Nottingham city center on Sept. 14, 1990.He threatened the victim with a knife before kissing her and pulling her to the ground in bushes, where he brutally raped her.The judge said Carnelley walked away thinking the prospect of the victim identifying him was minimal.He said the rapist had become successful and had a family, but told him his victim \u201chad nothing\u201d because he had destroyed her.In a statement read in court, the victim, now in her 50s, said: \u201cIt made me feel like I wanted to rip my insides out and my body didn\u2019t belong to me anymore. I never got over what happened to me.\u201dThe married Carnelley was snared after he challenged a group of rowdy teenagers causing a disturbance outside his home in 2010.One of the youngsters claimed he had assaulted them and called the police. He was let off with a caution, but his DNA was kept on file.In 2015, police carried out a cold case review of the unsolved 1990 rape and samples taken from the victim\u2019s clothed matched that of Carnelley.The court heard the probability of the DNA found on the rape victim not being Carnelley\u2019s was less than 1 in a billion.Defense attorney Ian Way said Carnelley had \u201cno specific recollection of this incident\u201d but had acknowledged the weight of the case against him and pleaded guilty.Speaking after the hearing, Detective Inspector Justine Dakin, from the Nottinghamshire police, said, \u201cThis was a terrifying ordeal for the victim.\u00a0She was frightened Carnelley would use further violence during the attack and was extremely scared throughout the whole incident.\u201cI would like to commend her for the immense bravery she has shown throughout the investigation. She is truly an incredible women, who has waited almost 27 years for justice to be served.\u201cI hope she can take some comfort from the fact that her attacker has finally been caught and is starting a lengthy prison sentence tonight.\u201cI would also like to commend DC Donna Robinson who investigated this offense thoroughly and meticulously and the forensic work involved which helped build the case against Carnelley and bring him to justice.\u201d",
