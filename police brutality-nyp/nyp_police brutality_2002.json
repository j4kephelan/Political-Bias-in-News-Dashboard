    "2002 - 3364": "Three cops in the Abner Louima torture case were astonished to see their convictions tossed yesterday by an appeals court \u2013 and the jubilant officers say they\u2019re now eyeing a return to the police force.  The surprise legal decision by the federal Court of Appeals in Manhattan reversed the convictions of officers Thomas Bruder and Thomas Wiese \u2013 and ordered a new trial for fellow cop Charles Schwarz.  \u201cI feel like a new man,\u201d Wiese told The Post. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long I can\u2019t even comprehend it.\u201d  Wiese said he may try to get back into NYPD blue.  \u201cI\u2019m going to talk about it with my lawyers,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s just great to be vindicated and finally be free. I\u2019m still in shock.\u201d  Schwarz was at a federal prison in Oklahoma City when a phone call from lawyer Ron Fischetti\u2019s secretary brought him the incredible news.  \u201cYou\u2019re going home, Chuck! You\u2019re going home!\u201d Phyllis Malgieri hollered over the line.  \u201cYou\u2019re kidding,\u201d the ex-cop said.  The amazing reversal of fortune for the officers upends one of the worst police-brutality cases in the history of New York City and the nation.  \u201cI believed from the beginning that I was representing an innocent man,\u201d said Fischetti, who quickly secured a March 7 hearing to try to spring Schwarz, who is serving a 15-year sentence, on bail.  Louima\u2019s lawyer, Sanford Rubenstein, said the Haitian immigrant will testify at another trial to ensure \u201cjustice is done.\u201d  Louima was wrongly arrested on Aug. 9, 1997, and taken to the 70th Precinct station house where Officer Justin Volpe sodomized him in the bathroom with a broom handle, nearly killing him.  Volpe eventually pleaded guilty in 1999, just before Schwarz was convicted of holding Louima during the assault.  The three-judge panel found Schwarz\u2019s trial lawyer, Stephen Worth, had an overwhelming conflict of interest surrounding the so-called \u201cblue wall of silence\u201d in police ranks because he had a $10 million contract to represent the officers\u2019 union.  The conflict was \u201cso severe that no rational defendant in Schwarz\u2019s position would have knowingly and intelligently desired Worth\u2019s representation,\u201d judges John Walker, Jos\u00e9 Cabranes and Chester Straub wrote in a 68-page decision.  The panel also decided jurors were improperly influenced when they learned during deliberations that Volpe had pleaded guilty and implicated a second officer.  The jury convicted Schwarz, 36, as the second man in the bathroom, then found out after the verdict that Volpe had said his accomplice was Wiese.  The judges also ruled the case against Bruder and Wiese was \u201cfatally flawed\u201d because authorities did not have enough evidence to show they meant to interfere with a federal grand jury probe.  Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Alan Vinegrad said he was disappointed by the decision, but was prepared to re-try the case.  Bruder, 35, and Wiese, 39, will not have to face a new trial, the judges ruled.  The two ex-officers were out on bail awaiting the appeals decision. They had been facing a five-year prison stretch.  Bruder\u2019s lawyer, Stuart London, said his client was thrilled and has \u201calready expressed an interest in petitioning the Police Department for reinstatement.\u201d  Volpe\u2019s lawyer, Marvyn Kornberg, said the decision could pave the way for his client to get a reduction from the 30-year sentence he\u2019s serving if he\u2019s called to testify in the new trial.",
    "2002 - 3903": "IT was torture all over again, though nothing like what Abner Louima endured the first time around.  Only a fool or a hyperbole addict would try to equate a judicial ruling with being sodomized by a cop with a broken broomstick in the back of a dingy bathroom.  But those in search of a metaphor for what passes as justice when it comes to police brutality in this town do not need to look any further.  \u201cJustice has taken a big blow today,\u201d said Henry Frank, executive director of the Haitian Centers Council, an umbrella group for social-service agencies, which has monitored police-brutality issues.  \u201cThe community is very sad and even mad. It means a lot of people can be victims the same way, and their attackers, police or not, can have their convictions overturned. It\u2019s a bad precedent.\u201d  Justice did not speak yesterday. Justices did. There has always been a difference.  Justices spoke in the 1857 Dred Scott decision when they ruled that black people couldn\u2019t be citizens because they were too busy being property.  Justices spoke in the 1896 Plessy vs. Ferguson decision when they pretended that America could be separate and equal at the same time.  Justices \u2013 these same justices on the district bench, in fact \u2013 spoke just six weeks ago when they said the black man who stabbed another man in Crown Heights just because he was Jewish, did not get a fair trial.  Justices are fallible human beings. Justice, on the other hand, is never, ever wrong.  \u201cI was in the courtroom every day and thought the evidence was overwhelming,\u201d said the Rev. Herbert Daughtry, pastor of Brooklyn\u2019s House of the Lord Pentecostal Church.  Daughtry said he is worried about the toll a new trial would take on Louima. And while the $8.7 million civil settlement the city and police union paid Louima and his lawyers was some measure of justice, it does little, without punishment, to make citizens feel safe from the police.  \u201cIt\u2019s the same message that was sent in the Diallo case,\u201d Daughtry said, recalling the unarmed African immigrant who was killed by Bronx cops who fired 41 bullets, cops who are free to walk the streets or fight fires to their hearts\u2019 content.  \u201cIt\u2019s just hard for this society to sentence police officers.\u201d  WHERE ARE THEY NOW?   The victim:   ABNER LOUIMA   Living in Miami Lakes, Fla., in house purchased after he received $8.75 million settlement from city and police union.   The accused cops:   JUSTIN VOLPE Jr.   In federal prison hospital in Rochester, Minn., serving 30-year term.   *   CHARLES SCHWARZ   In solitary confinement in federal prison in Springfield, Mo., serving 15-year sentence; will seek release pending a new trial.   *   THOMAS WIESE   Living in Bay Shore, L.I., doing house repairs, sometimes with Thomas Bruder.

    "2002 - 3032": "Two of the three ex-cops who won reversals of their convictions in the Abner Louima torture case want their jobs back \u2013 along with tens of thousands of dollars in back pay.  Joseph Tacopina, the lawyer for Thomas Wiese, said last night that the former cop will file papers Monday to be reinstated in the NYPD.  Wiese will also begin the process to obtain two years of back pay \u2013 $80,000, he said.  \u201cThere\u2019s two years worth of back pay that he\u2019s entitled to after being wrongfully terminated from the Police Department,\u201d the attorney said.  Stuart London, the lawyer for Thomas Bruder, said that ex-cop also plans to seek reinstatement \u2013 and will seek $100,000 in back pay.  \u201cThe basis on which they were terminated is no longer valid,\u201d London said.  The Police Department declined to comment.  On Thursday, a federal appeals court tossed out the convictions of Wiese and Bruder \u2013 as well as ex-cop Charles Schwarz \u2013 for trying to cover up one of the worst police-brutality cases in the city\u2019s history.  The court also reversed Schwarz\u2019s conviction on charges of holding Louima down in a Brooklyn station house bathroom while officer Justin Volpe sodomized him with a stick.  But it ordered a new trial for Schwarz, barring him from seeking immediate reinstatement.  State law allows Wiese and Bruder to apply to get their jobs back since their convictions were thrown out.  But once they apply, the NYPD will hold a departmental trial to see if they acted properly in the Louima case, experts said.  If they lose the trial and the department decides to fire them, it could argue they don\u2019t deserve back pay.  But Wiese and Bruder could argue they deserve their salaries from the time they were convicted to the time their convictions were reversed.  Schwarz, meanwhile, still can\u2019t believe that his conviction has been tossed out.  So much so that he called his wife, Andra, and his lawyer, Ron Fischetti, from his Oklahoma City prison yesterday to ask if he had been dreaming.  \u201cHe told us he had spent all night pacing his cell wondering whether he actually had heard what Andra and I had told him,\u201d Fischetti said.  Andra said, \u201cI and Ron kept on telling him, \u2018Yes, we did speak to you the day before and, yes, you are coming home.\u2019   \u201cHe is believing it now, particularly when I told him that his mother, Estelle, is going to cook him a Christmas dinner, even though it isn\u2019t Christmas,\u201d Andra added.  Fischetti said Schwarz\u2019s confusion is understandable since he had gone to the Oklahoma City prison \u201cwith no personal effects, no radio and, of course, no newspapers.\u201d  \u201cHe is in a 6-by-9-foot cell and has no personal contact with anyone. That could play tricks with one\u2019s mind.\u201d  On learning that Schwarz\u2019s conviction had been overturned, Fischetti immediately arranged a bail hearing next Thursday before Brooklyn federal Judge Reema Raggi.  And since Schwarz, 36, was free on bail before his June 8, 1999, conviction in the Louima case, he is expected to be freed on bond.  Additional reporting by Al Guart and Murray Weiss ",
    "2002 - 4948": "SO, let me get this straight: Only one guy brutalized Abner Louima and held him down at the same time \u2013 right? Must be, because everyone else involved in the case is now walking on sunshine.   Call me jaded, but ever notice how every racially motivated incident in this city gets re-tried, re-examined, re-thought, and re-opened until the outcome fits in with popular thought?   Look, I\u2019m not saying the cops who got nailed \u2013 Charles Schwarz, Thomas Bruder and Thomas Wiese \u2013 are guilty or were even involved in the attack on Louima. From the facts presented, it looks like they took the fall \u2013 but for whom? I\u2019m not a judge and I\u2019m not the jury. But the thing still stinks \u2013 nobody saw nuthin\u2019, heard nuthin\u2019, and did nuthin\u2019 about it.   So, let\u2019s all stop flapping about how the Louima case broke down the blue wall of silence. It\u2019s still standing \u2013 with nary a brick out of place.   You know what? At the end of the day, Stephen Worth, the lawyer who misrepresented Schwarz while representing the police union for $10 million is still a PBA attorney.   And Charles Schwarz, who clearly didn\u2019t do it, was, until Friday, doing hard time in solitary, while Justin Volpe, who clearly did do it, is doing soft time. His job? Working \u2013 dear Lord! \u2013 in a prison hospital.   Justice really is blind. And deaf. And mentally challenged.   DOUBLE TAKE: WHICH OF THESE TWINS HAS THE TONY?   LAST Week, 19 million terrified Grammy fans watched in horror as rocker Billy Joel morphed into comic Alan King onstage after being touched by crooner Tony Bennett. Terrible tragedy? Showbiz trickery? Or something more sinister?  After an exhaustive \u2013 not to mention exhausting \u2013 investigation by The Post, the ugly truth behind the massive cover-up can now be revealed: When touched by Tony Bennett, victims immediately go bald, grow a beard and start doing shtick. This is followed by an uncontrollable urge to join the Friars Club. Secret documents obtained exclusively by The Post reveal that any contact with Bennett and/or the live farm animal he wears on his head can bring about the horrifying change.  Worse, when left untreated, victims can morph into other, even stranger Friars Club members. In fact, Grammy sources claim that U2 frontman Bono mistakenly rubbed Bennett\u2019s head and on the spot turned into Milton Berle.

I\u2019m talking about Jessica Ferenczy and Police Officer Kathy Vigiano, who managed to knock Sir Rudy on his royal keister last week.  In a heated meeting, these two women \u2013 along with other widows of the fallen WTC rescue workers \u2013 confronted the ex-mayor and extracted a pledge that his Twin Towers Fund would give away $100 million within the next 60 days. So much for the charity\u2019s plans for a giant payroll, a fund that could possibly have remained open for up to 30 years, and families\u2019 fears of having to scramble for their rightful piece of the pie.  These widows and relatives managed to say what everybody else was thinking: We emptied our wallets from our hearts so that every hero\u2019s family would be taken care of. We didn\u2019t give so that socialites would have something to do, or so NYC could have another charity with dinner dances, floral arrangements and walk-a-thons. Spread the wealth around \u2013 now.

    "2002 - 2518": "The mere chance of winning $8.7 million is enough to have people line up outside convenience stores and buy lottery tickets, but for Abner Louima the money came at an unimaginably high price.  Years after the gruesome attack that forever linked his name with police brutality, Louima continues to suffer from injuries that have damaged his body and his mind.  \u201cHe suffered terrible physical injuries, and that\u2019s what the compensation is for,\u201d said his lawyer, Sanford Rubenstein. \u201cHe suffered psychological injuries as well.\u201d  In the months since he dropped lawsuits against the city and the police union in exchange for an $8.7 million settlement, Louima has bought a house in an upper-middle-class Miami suburb and has been seen making his rounds in a high-priced sport utility vehicle.  But experts in settlement cases said Louima is not acting outside the norm, and is more than entitled to improve his lifestyle.  \u201cThe settlement represents a vindication of his rights,\u201d said civil-rights attorney Norman Siegel. \u201cI have no problem with the fact that he got millions of dollars. The victim needs to be compensated not only for his injuries but because of the violation of his civil rights.\u201d  Siegel, who worked pro bono on police brutality cases as director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said the compensation attorneys receive is incentive for lawyers to be more aggressive.  Louima, 35, lives in Miami Lakes with his wife and three children in a five-bedroom tile-roofed home he paid $220,000 for. He owns a 1993 Mercedes-Benz 300E and 1997 Land Rover 4.0 SE, both of which he bought used.  Of the $8.7 million, one-third has already gone to lawyers, and another portion was set aside to pay taxes on the settlement. Of the rest, the bulk will be paid in a lump sum, but some will be disbursed in $5,000 monthly installments over 20 years.  \u201cHe is attempting now to rebuild his life,\u201d Rubenstein said.  Louima, after an arrest in 1997, was sodomized with a broken broomstick in the bathroom of the 70th Precinct station house. Rubenstein said Louima remains at risk for further medical problems.  Louima has remained relatively silent in the days since a federal appeals court overturned the convictions of three cops accused of conspiracy in the attack.  But in July, after the settlement was reached, Louima was quick to put the money in perspective.  \u201cI don\u2019t really see myself as a rich man,\u201d Louima said at the time. \u201cI see myself as someone who is lucky to be alive and able to see some justice.\u201d",
    "2002 - 1147": "A nurse was brutally attacked at a Bronx hospital yesterday by a robber who ruptured her tonsils when he rammed his fingers down her throat to silence her terrified screams, police said.  Jerry Miles, 28, became enraged when Charina Adamos, 32, an emergency-room nurse at Bronx Lebanon Hospital, refused to give up her wallet.  He threw her to the ground and began beating her, police said.  The plucky Adamos, who is only 5 feet 1 inch tall, started screaming and, to silence her, the Bronx man thrust his fingers down her throat \u2013 rupturing her tonsils, cops said. As Adamos lay bleeding, Miles fled \u2013 his victim\u2019s blood all over him.  When hospital workers spotted him, he tried to throw them off his trail by saying, \u201cSomeone is hurt back there.\u201d  But Miles got lost in the corridors and was nabbed by two 44th Precinct cops, Christopher Mattison and Michael Calamari, who happened to be there.  He was held on assault and robbery charges.  Adamos underwent several hours of surgery yesterday and was in stable condition.  \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d said her sister Mylene Sion, also a nurse at the hospital. \u201cShe\u2019s OK, but then the pain is there.\u201d ",
    "2002 - 3178": "Confusion among cops as to who should have investigated the ghoulish murder of a Brooklyn couple may have resulted in the case remaining unsolved for more than 20 years.  Howard Green, 51, and his girlfriend Carol Marron, 33, were bludgeoned to death in a possible devil worship-related attack in 1979.  Their eyeballs were blown out, the tips of their ears cut off and almost all their blood had been drained through approximately 30 puncture marks made in identical places on the two bodies, investigators said.  The two corpses were bound in canvas and rugs and dumped in West Paterson, N.J., where they were discovered by a boy walking his dog.  A Post investigation into the double homicide found not only that the trail to the brutal killer has gone cold, but it may never have been followed properly.  Retired detectives from Brooklyn\u2019s 88th Precinct and the West Paterson Police Department, along with the Passaic County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, confirmed they all thought the others had done the follow-up investigation.  \u201cTechnically, Jersey\u2019s got the responsibility [to follow up],\u201d said retired Brooklyn detective James Devereaux. He says he assisted the original investigation of the Brooklyn couple\u2019s murder as a courtesy to the Passaic prosecutor.  But retired West Paterson detective Thomas Hemsey says the investigation was left in New York, where the murders probably occurred.  \u201cDevereaux was supposed to keep following up on it if any new information came,\u201d Hemsey said.  Capt. Ed Murphy of the Passaic Prosecutor\u2019s Office also put the burden on New York and was surprised to learn the case was unsolved.  A New York police spokesman, Walter Burns, said the Brooklyn Cold Case Squad is currently not working on the case.  The Post investigation also found startling inconsistencies in the investigators\u2019 recollections of their work.  Devereaux said he twice interviewed a resident of the victims\u2019 neighborhood, who, he reported, admitted to having drained the blood of mice he kept. He said he wanted to impress his girlfriend at the time, Devereaux recalled.  The man, who now lives out of state, dismissed Devereaux\u2019s recollection and says he never met the detective.  \u201cHell no, I never said that stuff,\u201d he said, adding he was on a hitchhiking holiday in Texas at the time of the murders.  Devereaux said he thought the murders were part of a ritual because he recalled satanic paraphernalia being found inside the victims\u2019 apartment at 280 DeKalb Ave. in downtown Brooklyn. He said the apartment was in disarray and drenched in blood, as if a struggle had occurred there.  But retired West Paterson detective Joseph Lambert said the apartment was neat and clean, with no signs of devil worship.  Lambert said the building\u2019s landlord, Jonathan Nelson, wanted Green\u2019s apartment for his terminally ill father because Green was paying \u201cpeanuts\u201d in rent each month. He said Nelson had taken Green to court over it.  Nelson confirmed to The Post that he had wanted the apartment for his father because it was on the ground floor and easily accessible. He said he had nothing against Green and Marron and had been interviewed by police at the time<strong>.</strong>",
    "2002 - 2984": "Homicide detectives have impounded a car they believe was driven by the boyfriend of the estranged wife of murdered millionaire Ted Ammon on the weekend he was killed, The Post has learned.  Experts were searching the blue, 1999 Audi A6 wagon for blood or other evidence connected to the vicious crime, sources said.  Detectives believe Danny Pelosi \u2013 then the boyfriend and now the husband of Ammon\u2019s estranged wife, Generosa \u2013 had been driving the $40,000 vehicle on the weekend Ammon was bludgeoned to death inside his $10 million East Hampton mansion, the sources said.  The naked body of Ammon \u2013 killed while he slept \u2013 was discovered Oct. 22 by his business partner, who became concerned when he failed to show up in his office.  A trail of blood led down the stairs and out the French doors.  Police experts combed the Audi and performed lab tests under the theory that Ammon\u2019s blood, which was splattered on the walls and bed, might have been transferred to a vehicle by his killer.  Ammon, 52, loved automobiles and owned at least four. They included the black, vintage BMW that Pelosi was driving a month before the murder, when he was arrested and charged with drunken driving about a mile away from the ivy-covered East Hampton mansion.  A few weeks after the brutal slaying, Pelosi was observed driving around in a third vehicle belonging to Ammon, a 1995 Buick Century station wagon.  The judge in the DWI case, Pelosi\u2019s fourth drunken-driving arrest, took the electrician\u2019s passport away last month, making it impossible for Pelosi to join his wife at their stately manor house in England.  Pelosi and his new bride have denied any involvement in the murder. His lawyer yesterday declined comment on the latest developments.  The murder was the first slaying in East Hampton in almost 20 years.  The weekend of the killing, neighbors said they found it strange that they never heard two dogs that Ammon had with him bark, as they might expect if a stranger entered the house.  \u201cWe were there all weekend, and we didn\u2019t hear any dogs barking,\u201d said one neighbor in the exclusive section near Jerry Seinfeld\u2019s estate, who asked not to be identified.  \u201cThat\u2019s the question \u2013 why didn\u2019t I hear the dogs barking?\u201d the neighbor asked.  \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible thing . . . I would be very relieved if they would find out who did this.\u201d  The murder of the financier and philanthropist came amid a bitter divorce and custody battle.  Just before he was murdered, Ammon told friends that he had been granted joint custody of their two children and predicted he would soon be given full custody.  At the same time, Mrs. Ammon told a friend that she would never let Ammon get custody of the kids.  She said she had pictures of her husband with other women and intended to use them to \u201chang him\u201d in the divorce and that she now \u201cwanted everything.\u201d  After his death, Mrs. Ammon \u2013 now Mrs. Pelosi \u2013 inherited Ammon\u2019s entire $80 million estate and has full custody of the 11-year-old twins.
