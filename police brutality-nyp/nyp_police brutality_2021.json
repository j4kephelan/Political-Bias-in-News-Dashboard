    "2021 - 3547": "GOP freshman Rep. Lauren Boebert on Wednesday accused Democrats including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of \u201cnormalizing violence\u201d ahead of last week\u2019s Capitol riot.Boebert (R-Colo.) said during debate on <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/01/13/house-begins-hearing-to-impeach-trump-for-second-time/\">impeaching President Trump</a> that he wasn\u2019t entirely to blame for the rampage committed by his supporters, noting that some Democrats declined to denounce anti-police brutality riots last year.\u201cI rise today to oppose this impeachment and denounce the recent violence on the Capitol, just as I opposed the previous impeachment and the violence we\u2019ve all witnessed all summer long across our great country,\u201d she said.\u201cMake no mistake here, the hypocrisy of the left is on full display.\u201dBoebert, in her position for less than a month, took specific aim at Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), noting that <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/07/13/aocs-dishonest-callous-answer-to-nycs-surging-street-violence/\">she said last year</a> that rising crime may be caused by people who \u201ceither need to shoplift some bread or go hungry that night.\u201d\u201cWhat about the gentlewoman from New York who defended the looting by saying looters just wanted loaves of bread? Well, the last I checked, Best Buy and Teslas and stores of the like do not produce baked goods. Where\u2019s the accountability for the left after encouraging and normalizing violence?\u201d she said.Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Both congresswomen are in their early 30s and have passionate followings.Boebert concluded her speech saying, \u201cI call bullcrap when I hear the Democrats demanding unity. Sadly, they are only unified in hate.\u201dDemocrats and at least six Republicans are expected to vote Wednesday to impeach Trump for allegedly inciting the riot, which followed <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/01/06/trump-addresses-supporters-at-dc-rally-ahead-of-vote-certification/\">a speech near the White House</a> in which the president told thousands of backers that the election was stolen by fraud. <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/01/07/who-are-the-four-who-died-in-the-dc-protest-at-the-capitol/\">Four Trump supporters and one police officer</a> died as rioters disrupted certification of President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s victory.Boebert recently drew headlines for vowing to bring a handgun onto the House floor, and was in <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/01/13/rep-boebert-clashes-with-capitol-police-over-metal-detector/\">a standoff Tuesday</a> over her refusal to consent to new metal detector policies that some Democrats say were enacted due to Boebert.Other Republicans have walked around the new metal detectors, prompting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to order US Capitol Police on Wednesday to move the equipment so that it\u2019s impossible to walk around it.Trump is expected to be impeached by the House on Wednesday, but the Senate won\u2019t hold a trial <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/01/13/trump-impeachment-will-be-heard-after-he-leaves-office-mcconnell/\">until after he leaves office</a> on Jan. 20. Some Republicans are advocating a censure that \u2014 like conviction in the Senate \u2014 could ban Trump from holding office again.No House Republicans voted to impeach Trump during his first impeachment in December 2019. The Senate voted along party lines <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/02/05/trump-acquitted-in-senate-impeachment-trial/\">to acquit Trump in February</a>, with a sole Republican, Utah Sen.

Barrett then repeatedly beat his wife with a fireplace poker and stabbed her in the lower back with a knife multiple times, court papers allege. Barrett claims he blacked out during the attack. The 40-year-old stashed his wife\u2019s body in their basement and kept it there for two days before turning himself in to police on Monday. Investigators found Mary Barrett\u2019s lifeless body with a hole in her skull in the basement of their home later that day.

The report was released less than 48 hours before Trump leaves office.The document says, \u201cDeliberately destructive scholarship shatters the civic bonds that unite all Americans. It silences the discourse essential to a free society by breeding division, distrust, and hatred among citizens. And it is the intellectual force behind so much of the violence in our cities, suppression of free speech in our universities, and defamation of our treasured national statues and symbols.\u201dTrump established the commission in part in response to a national movement to remove or deface the statues of slaveholders or colonial figures. Trump critics, however, vowed to resist his push to put a rosier spin on US history.The\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/The-Presidents-Advisory-1776-Commission-Final-Report.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">new report</a>\u00a0says \u201cColleges peddle resentment and contempt for American principles and history alike\u2026 [and] shames Americans by highlighting only the sins of their ancestors, and teaches claims of systemic racism that can only be eliminated by more discrimination.\u201dThe report says that the US is exceptionable because, \u201cNo one is above the law\u201d \u2014 a cliche <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1348004115121647622\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recently applied</a> by President-elect Joe Biden to Trump after his supporters stormed the Capitol and disrupted certification of the election.\u201cPatriotic education must have at its center a respect for the rule of law, including the Declaration and the Constitution, so that we have what John Adams called \u2018a government of laws, and not of men,'\u201d the report says.The report argues against presenting slavery as an indelible sin of the Founding Fathers.\u201cThe most common charge levelled against the founders, and hence against our country itself, is that they were hypocrites who didn\u2019t believe in their stated principles, and therefore the country they built rests on a lie. This charge is untrue, and has done enormous damage, especially in recent years, with a devastating effect on our civic unity and social fabric,\u201d the report says, adding: \u201cMany Americans labor under the illusion that slavery was somehow a uniquely American evil.\u201dThe report argues that in fact, \u201cThe foundation of our Republic planted the seeds of the<br/>death of slavery in America.\u201d\u201cIt is important to remember that, as a question of practical politics, no durable union could have been formed without a compromise among the states on the issue of slavery. Is it reasonable to believe that slavery could have been abolished sooner had the slave states not been in a union with the free? Perhaps. But what is momentous is that a people that included slaveholders founded their nation on the proposition that \u2018all men are created equal.; So why did they say that without immediately abolishing slavery? To establish the principle of consent as the ground of all political legitimacy and to check against any possible future drift toward or return to despotism, for sure. But also, in Lincoln\u2019s words, \u2018to declare the right, so that the enforcement of it might follow as fast as circumstances should permit,'\u201d the report says.The commission was chaired by Hillsdale College President Larry Arnn. Retired Vanderbilt University political science professor Carol Swain was co-chair of the initiative and the commission\u2019s executive director was Hillsdale College government professor Matthew Spalding.",
    "2021 - 2566": "China should answer for the death of a 19-year-old <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/09/22/china-reportedly-forced-500k-tibetan-farmers-into-labor-camps/\">Tibetan monk who was brutally beaten</a> while in police custody, a humanitarian watchdog group claims.The New York-based Human Rights Watch has called on Chinese authorities to be held accountable in the January death of Tibetan monk Tenzin Nyima, who was initially detained in November 2019 after attending a pro-Tibetan Independence protest outside a government office, officials said.\u201cChinese authorities have once again turned arbitrary detention into a death sentence,\u201d the organization\u2019s China director, Sophie Richardson, said in a statement Thursday.Nyima, who was later released in May, was taken back into Chinese custody in August for purportedly sharing news of his arrest and that of six other Tibetans \u2014 including a 16-year-old boy \u2014 with contacts in India, as well as online.Nyima\u2019s relatives were then told to come and get him from the prison in early October, with officials citing a medical condition. Sources told Human Rights Watch that Nyima could not move or speak due to beatings and malnourishment while in custody, leading to an acute respiratory infection and other injuries.Nyima was taken to a hospital on Oct. 9, but had already lost consciousness. A hospital report showed he had been listed in critical condition for 10 days prior to even being released to his family, HRW officials said.Doctors at the hospital discharged Nyima weeks later, declaring his injuries would ultimately prove fatal. However, he was then admitted on Dec. 1 to a second hospital \u2014 while still in a coma \u2013where he was again discharged on medical grounds that his condition was fatal. He died shortly after at home, HRW officials said.Trials for Nyima and six other Tibetans were held in November. Four other monks and two local residents \u2014 all of whom are between 16 and 23 years old \u2014 were sentenced to one to five years in prison in connection to one of the protests and for spreading news about the arrests at the first protest.Nyima was charged with \u201cincitement to split the country,\u201d but his sentence was ultimately not announced \u2014 which HRW officials believe had to do with his medical condition.\u201cUrgent, grim cases like the imprisonment of the young Tibetans have prompted UN experts to call for a mechanism to monitor and report graves abuses by Chinese authorities,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cA failure to hold accountable those responsible for Tenzin Nyima\u2019s death enables future appalling violations.\u201d",

Dozens of cities saw Black Lives Matter and Antifa-inspired protests or riots break out in response to George Floyd\u2019s death on May 25, but Portland stood out above the others because its violence lasted for months.\u00a0On Aug. 29, 2020, that violence culminated in murder when a 48-year-old volunteer security \u201cofficer\u201d for BLM-Antifa killed a Trump supporter in the city\u2019s downtown.\u00a0Michael Forest Reinoehl shot Aaron \u201cJay\u201d Danielson, 39, using a pistol at near point-blank range after lying in wait for him around a street corner. The shooting was caught on camera from a distance by a live streamer. A person believed to be Reinoehl shouted: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a couple right here!\u201d (Danielson was walking with a friend.) Two shots rang out, and Danielson fell face\u2010first to the ground. He was shot in the chest and died instantly.\u00a0Earlier in the day, hundreds of vehicles had gathered in Clackamas County, near Portland, for a grassroots-organized \u201cTrump 2020 Cruise Rally.\u201d It was a mass vehicle caravan rally celebrating all that Antifa hate: President Trump, law enforcement and America. The day was peaceful as drivers made their way out of a mall\u2019s parking lot and onto a route that took them in and around the Portland area. But trouble was waiting when they drove downtown.\u00a0Drivers waving US, Trump and \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d flags were met by crowds of masked Antifa rioters armed with projectile weapons. The drivers and their passengers came loaded with their own tools and weapons. Antifa hurled eggs and rocks at the caravan. They also sprayed cars and passengers with urine from water guns. Some of them tried to stop the vehicles by standing in the road and pushing against the cars. In response, members of the caravan used pepper spray and shot people with paintballs. No one sustained real injuries, and the conflict fizzled out.\u00a0By around 8:30 p.m., the caravan vehicles were gone. But some of its participants walked around. Aaron Danielson strolled through downtown with his friend Chandler Pappas. Both had been passengers in the caravan earlier in the day and are affiliated with Patriot Prayer, the Portland-area pro-Trump group. Danielson was a single man who ran a moving company. His Oregon criminal record includes convictions for driving-related misdemeanors in the 2000s.\u00a0According to the criminal complaint against Reinoehl, at approximately 8:44 p.m., he was walking ahead of Danielson and Pappas. He looked back at them and reached toward his waistband. Portland Police Detective Rico Beniga wrote this about Reinoehl and his companion (named as Subject #2) in an affidavit:\u00a0<em>REINOEHL turns into the garage entry and reaches toward his left front waist area. REINOEHL conceals himself, waits, and watches as Danielson and Pappas continue walking by. Danielson and Pappas do not appear to interact or communicate with anyone and continue southbound on SW 3rd Avenue .\u2009.\u2009. After Danielson and Pappas walk by, REINOEHL begins to emerge from garage while still reaching toward the pocket or pouch on his waistband. Subject #2 looks back toward REINOEHL. Danielson and Pappas cross westbound across SW 3rd Avenue and REINOEHL and Subject #2 follow them. The shooting occurs shortly thereafter and is not captured on the surveillance video.\u00a0</em>When news spread on social media that someone had been shot, Antifa accounts and Antifa-sympathetic journalists erroneously spread the claim that a \u201cblack comrade\u201d had been killed by a Trump supporter.\u00a0\u201cThe far-right have been building up to this for the last three weeks. The [Portland Police Bureau] encouraged this escalation,\u201d tweeted Rose City Antifa. Another Antifa group, Popular Mobilization, tweeted: \u201cAs we process our trauma over this tragic turn of events, let\u2019s remember the importance of standing together as a community in opposition to fascist violence.\u201d\u00a0Within a few hours, it was revealed that the homicide victim was a conservative who vocally supported law enforcement and the president. Photos of Danielson\u2019s body on the ground showed he had a \u201cthin blue line\u201d patch on his clothing, a symbol of support for police, and a hat bearing the insignia of the Patriot Prayer group. As soon as that news spread among Antifa, the somber mood in the crowd, which by now had gathered outside the Justice Center, became celebratory.\u00a0\u201cI just got word the person who died was a Patriot Prayer person \u2014 he was a f\u2013king Nazi!\u201d yelled a woman on a bullhorn. People shouted \u201cYeah!\u201d in response. She continued: \u201cOur community held its own, and took out the trash. I am not going to shed any tears over a Nazi.\u201d\u00a0Even though none of the Antifa knew the identity of the deceased at that time, it didn\u2019t matter. They only needed to know that he was a Trump supporter. They celebrated his death through dancing, song and the burning of American flags.\u00a0Later, at a memorial service for Danielson organized by local conservative activists in Vancouver, Wash., Patriot Prayer leader Joey Gibson urged the crowd not to seek vengeance.\u00a0\u201cI know that Jay would not want that,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cJay wants us to stand up for what we believe in, and he does not want any more violence, guys. He does not want any more violence.\u201d\u00a0Our community held its own, and took out the trashIn the immediate hours after Danielson\u2019s murder, Internet sleuths went to work analyzing the blurry stills showing Reinoehl, who was unknown at the time, running from the scene in the livestream video. Based on his distinctive clothing, they found other clips from earlier in the evening showing him walking around downtown, at times pumping his fist in support of BLM, and frequently having his hand ready on a concealed gun. What positively identified him to Internet sleuths as well as law enforcement was a large tattoo of a black power fist on his neck.\u00a0Once I found out Reinoehl\u2019s name, I immediately searched online for his social media accounts. Though most Antifa are quick to hide their online presence, Reinoehl still had an active Instagram account where he had posted throughout the summer riots. Within seconds of skimming his posts, it confirmed what I suspected all along. Not only was he obsessively in support of BLM, he identified himself as \u201c100 percent antifa\u201d and wrote long posts about the need for violent revolution.\u00a0His other posts on Instagram reflected the same themes of viewing the current riots as part of an armed struggle for revolution. In one post, the divorced father of two claimed to have served in the US Army but an Army spokesperson said they had no record of Reinoehl. A friend of his later told The Wall Street Journal that Reinoehl worked random odd contracting jobs in recent years. He was a former professional snowboarder whose criminal history in Oregon includes driving-related offenses.\u00a0Though he was never known to dress in black bloc, the unofficial uniform for Antifa, he certainly espoused their ideology. While calling for the abolishment of police, Reinoehl was auditioning for a role in the armed \u201cself\u2010defense\u201d community, which BLM Antifa managed to install in place of the police in Portland in June last year. Reinoehl got the job.\u00a0Spending time in the \u201cCapitol Hill Autonomous Zone,\u201d or CHAZ, in Seattle, I had already seen up-close what happens when city officials make law enforcement retreat from the public. Anarchists and other extremists move in and establish their own rules. And they aren\u2019t shy about using violence. In fact, they revel in it. As in CHAZ, those who fashion themselves as \u201csecurity\u201d for racial justice are often the most violent, cruel and brutal.\u00a0The last few months of Reinoehl\u2019s life before his shooting show he was a violent man with no regard for the well-being of others. Over and over, authorities failed to prosecute or jail him, even when they had several opportunities to do so. This is the travesty in the killing of Aaron Danielson. It could have been prevented.\u00a0Nearly two months before Danielson\u2019s murder, Portland Police actually had Reinoehl in custody \u2014 but he was let go. On July 5, 2020, during the start of violent riots targeting the Mark O. Hatfield U.S. Courthouse, Reinoehl was detained and cited for possessing an illegal and loaded gun in a public place, resisting arrest and interfering with police. He was photographed fighting cops while they subdued him to the ground. In the photo released by Portland Police, his pistol is seen on the ground next to him. A source tells me that police released Reinoehl because he claimed to be injured. The Multnomah County District Attorney\u2019s Office then dropped all of his charges for unknown reasons.But that wasn\u2019t the only missed opportunity to stop Reinoehl. On June 8, 2020, he and his teenage son were racing in separate vehicles in eastern Oregon. Reinoehl was stopped by a state trooper, who saw his 11-year-old daughter as the passenger. According to state police, they found prescription drugs, marijuana and an illegally possessed loaded Glock pistol in the vehicle. Reinoehl had a warrant for that arrest due to his failure to appear in court. But he was never apprehended.\u00a0One day prior to Danielson\u2019s Aug.\u200929 murder, Reinoehl attended a BLM-Antifa riot outside Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler\u2019s condo. He was photographed with his young child, who was brandishing a baseball bat.\u00a0Immediately after the killing, Reinoehl went on the run. Five days later, he emerged in a Vice News interview with sympathetic left-wing freelance writer Donovan Farley. In the interview from an undisclosed location, Reinoehl admitted to the killing, saying: \u201cI had no choice. I mean, I, I had a choice. I could have sat there and watched them kill a friend of mine of color. But I wasn\u2019t going to do that.\u201d He said that Danielson threatened him with a knife even though no evidence supports the claim. In fact, the video surveillance seconds before the shooting showed Reinoehl waiting for Danielson and following him.\u00a0Reinoehl also admitted to being a fugitive, saying he was not turning himself in because he thinks police are collaborating with right wingers.\u00a0Five days after Danielson was killed, I received word from law-enforcement sources that US Marshals had killed Reinoehl in Washington state. A federal task force made up of local officers located him in an apartment near Lacey, Wash., about 120 miles from Portland. A statement from former Attorney General William Barr the following day said that Reinoehl attempted to escape arrest and \u201cproduced a firearm\u201d before being shot dead. However, a New York Times report the following month said that all but one of the 22 witnesses interviewed by investigators recalled not hearing officers identify themselves or give commands before the shooting. The sheriff\u2019s team conducting the homicide investigation did find a .380-caliber pistol in Reinoehl\u2019s pocket, as well as a semi-automatic rifle in his car. The investigation remains ongoing.\u00a0Like the Antifa killers who came before him, Reinoehl was instantly made into a martyr by Antifa in Portland. The night he was killed on Sept. 3, 2020, rioters attacked a police building in southeast Portland. On the ground outside, they graffitied over and over: \u201cYou murdered Michael Reinoehl.\u201d\u00a0The morning after, while driving around Portland, I saw a large graffiti message on the side of a police building that read, \u201cLong live Mike.\u201d\u00a0Antifa even turned one of the bridge pillars in north Portland into a \u201cmemorial\u201d for Reinoehl featuring spray-painted eulogies. His death also prompted calls for vengeance by Antifa in other parts of the country. In December, Antifa hung a banner over Storrow Drive in Boston that read, \u201c<a href=\"https://peoples-voice.org/2020/12/14/avenge-michael-reinoehl/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Avenge Michael Reinoehl</a>.\u201d"
