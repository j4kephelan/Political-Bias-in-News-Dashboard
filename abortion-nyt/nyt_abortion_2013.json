    "2013 - 471": "After my post yesterday contrasting the challenges the Francis era may offer to American Catholics who feel at home on the political right of center with the opportunities it may open up to their more liberal co-religionists, it\u2019s only fair to also point out the implicit challenge that the new pope is offering to liberal Catholics as well \u2014 or at least to liberal Catholics who see their relationship to the church in terms of fidelity as well as criticism and dissent.",
    "2013 - 476": "Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, author of the 5-to-4 opinion in June that struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, may well be a hero to the gay rights community, and deservedly so. But he\u2019s also the author of the 5-to-4 opinion that upheld the federal ban on so-called partial birth abortion back in 2007, and abortion-rights advocates have viewed with something close to dread the prospect that he could play a similarly decisive role in the Supreme Court\u2019s next abortion case. ",
    "2013 - 501": "A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has dealt a grievous blow to the reproductive health and rights of Texas women. On Thursday, the court allowed Texas, pending the court\u2019s final resolution of the case, to enforce a provision in the state\u2019s new abortion law that requires doctors who perform the procedure to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. As a result, a third of the state\u2019s 36 licensed abortion clinics have stopped providing abortions. ",
    "2013 - 566": "I was 23 weeks pregnant with my first child when we had our anatomic ultrasound here in Chile. In a darkened examination room, the doctor drew the wand over my belly, and our beautiful baby appeared on screen. His body flickered of his own volition, and I squeezed my husband\u2019s shoulder in relief. The doctor measured the circumference of our baby\u2019s head, drew digital white lines down each limb, and examined the kidneys, stomach and spine. He confirmed the gender of our boy and sent his heartbeat to travel across the bottom of the screen at 142 beats per minute.",
    "2013 - 647": "My column two weeks ago on what other developed countries\u2019 abortion laws tell us about the impact of abortion restrictions prompted a number of rebuttals, most notably from Scott Lemieux at The American Prospect and Katha Pollitt at The Nation. To my point that a number of European countries restrict second and third-trimester abortions without producing any obviously disastrous consequences for women\u2019s health and professional advancement, both Lemieux and Pollitt argue that the European bans only work because the countries in question make first-trimester abortion more accessible and affordable than does the United States. Here\u2019s Lemieux:",
    "2013 - 668": "\u201cAfter Tiller,\u201d a new documentary by Martha Shane and Lana Wilson, is a partisan document in the culture wars. It could hardly be otherwise, since the film\u2019s subject, abortion, is one where common ground is elusive, if not philosophically untenable. The four doctors interviewed and observed on screen, who the film says are the only ones in the United States openly performing third-trimester abortions, are heroic figures in the filmmakers\u2019 eyes, but are condemned as murderers by those on the other side. It would be nice to believe that a movie like this could provoke civil and respectful dialogue about an intensely polarizing issue, but let\u2019s not kid ourselves.",
    "2013 - 737": "A grand jury in Harris County found no evidence of criminal behavior by a Houston doctor who performs late-term abortions and was accused by anti-abortion groups of killing live-born babies. In May, in a tape distributed by Operation Rescue, some former clinic employees accused Dr. Douglas Karpen of performing sloppy procedures and killing babies after they emerged from the womb, comparing him to Dr. Kermit Gosnell of Philadelphia, who had been convicted of murder that month after similar allegations. But in a statement issued Saturday, Devon Anderson, the Harris County district attorney, said: \u201cAn independent grand jury concluded, after lengthy investigation and deliberation, that the evidence does not justify an indictment.\" ",
    "2013 - 799": "A state judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked enforcement of a law requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. The law is similar to measures promoted by anti-abortion groups and blocked by courts in other states, including Mississippi and Alabama. It would have forced North Dakota\u2019s only abortion center, the Red River Clinic in Fargo, to close because it uses out-of-state doctors who have been refused admitting privileges at local hospitals. Medical experts say such requirements do not improve patient safety since hospitals will accept and treat emergency patients regardless. The North Dakota lawsuit that resulted in Wednesday\u2019s temporary injunction was brought on behalf of the clinic by the Center for Reproductive Rights, based in New York.",
    "2013 - 947": "Many liberal Catholics have been encouraged by Pope Francis\u2019s comments about sexual ethics in a recent interview. His general point was that these are lesser matters, not to be emphasized at the expense of the church\u2019s essential message of healing and salvation. Asked about homosexuality, he simply evoked God\u2019s love for all humans: \u201cwhen God looks at a gay person, does he endorse the existence of this person with love, or reject and condemn this person? . . . In life, God accompanies persons, and we must accompany them, starting from their situation. It is necessary to accompany them with mercy.\u201d More widely, he said: \u201cWe cannot insist only on issues related to abortion, gay marriage and the use of contraceptive methods . . . . The dogmatic and moral teachings of the church are not all equivalent. The church\u2019s pastoral ministry cannot be obsessed with the transmission of a disjointed multitude of doctrines to be imposed insistently.\u201d",
    "2013 - 1012": "In November, the magazine published\u00a0Emily Bazelon\u2019s profile of Charmaine Yoest, the head of the Americans United for Life, an anti-abortion group, which has been working with Republican state legislators to write laws making access to abortion more difficult. In her article, Bazelon wrote about the controversy that was sparked when Todd Akin, a Republican congressman from Missouri who was running for the Senate, claimed that victims of \u201clegitimate rape\u201d cannot become pregnant. Akin\u2019s comments had apparently been based on, as Bazelon wrote, a\u201c1972 essay by an obstetrician named Fred Mecklenburg, who cited a Nazi experiment in which women were told they were on their way to die in the gas chambers \u2014 and then were allowed to live, so that doctors could check whether they would still ovulate. Since few did, Mecklenburg claimed that women exposed to the emotional trauma of rape wouldn\u2019t be able to become pregnant, either.\u201d Mecklenburg\u2019s essay was published in a book financed by the anti-abortion group."
