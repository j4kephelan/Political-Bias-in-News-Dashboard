    "2018 - 340": "Planned Parenthood, under fire from conservatives in Washington and state capitols, chose Leana Wen, an emergency room doctor whose family fled China when she was a child, as its next president Wednesday, picking a woman who won praise for her steadying hand as Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner during the city\u2019s convulsive protests in 2015.",
    "2018 - 350": "KINGSPORT, Tenn. \u2014 Inside the Kingsport Chamber of Commerce one morning last month, a few dozen voters sipped coffee and listened for 45 minutes to Representative Marsha Blackburn tick off all the reasons that this traditionally Republican stronghold in northeastern Tennessee should support her in one of the most high-stakes Senate races this year.",
    "2018 - 361": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Pressure is intensifying on undecided senators before a vote to confirm President Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, with one senator \u2014 Susan Collins, Republican of Maine \u2014 reporting that she and her staff have been targeted with a barrage of calls, including some using vulgar language and threats to push her to vote against Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh.",
    "2018 - 370": "In his first appearance before the nation, Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh positioned himself as an ally of social change for women in America. Standing beside President Trump at the White House, Judge Kavanaugh spoke of being a father of daughters and a coach to a girls\u2019 basketball team. He hailed his mother\u2019s legal career. He boasted that most of his clerks had been women.",
    "2018 - 392": "As abortion rights have come under increasing attack in the United States, commentators have held up self-administered abortion pills as a backup plan for a post-Roe world. They point to the millions of pregnant women worldwide who are using pills to self-manage abortion, citing them as an example of what reproductive health care might look like should in-clinic abortions be made illegal. ",
    "2018 - 410": "Judge Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s voluminous record, his opinion of the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark abortion ruling, Roe v. Wade, and his views on legal precedent have deservedly been scrutinized in the lead-up to his confirmation hearings next week. But the Supreme Court\u2019s 1992 decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, more than Roe, holds the key to understanding the stakes of Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s potential confirmation. ",
    "2018 - 424": "Shortly after his inauguration, Donald Trump, uniquely attentive to his debt to the religious right, appointed the anti-abortion activist E. Scott Lloyd to head the Office of Refugee Resettlement, despite Lloyd\u2019s lack of relevant experience. The position gave Lloyd authority over unaccompanied minors caught crossing into the United States, authority Lloyd exploited to try to stop pregnant migrants from getting abortions.",
    "2018 - 474": "You are the new president of Planned Parenthood. What were some of your first exposures to the clinic? My mom was a patient when I was a kid, and I volunteered as a patient escort when I was a medical student. I remember thinking: What kind of world do we live in where, in order to get health care, women \u2014 and men, but mainly women \u2014 have to walk through lines of protesters? The politicization of care deeply troubles me. That\u2019s, unfortunately, the reality that we\u2019re in.",
    "2018 - 536": "So it\u2019s all over but the voting. I\u2019m writing this column on the assumption that Judge Brett Kavanaugh will soon be Justice Kavanaugh, despite the Democrats\u2019 continuing efforts to convert a futile battle over ideology into an ugly one over transparency and ethics. By the first Monday in October or soon thereafter, the Roberts court version 5.0 (accounting for the earlier arrival of Justices Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Neil Gorsuch since Chief Justice John Roberts took his seat in September 2005) will be underway.",
    "2018 - 550": "When I was in medical school in the 1990s, it was rare to hear abortion mentioned as an option for pregnant women at all \u2014 let alone for there to be in-depth training on how to counsel patients on a full range of pregnancy options, including termination. My generation of physicians simply wasn\u2019t prepared to provide basic, comprehensive reproductive health care. Even though it had been 20 years since Roe v. Wade legalized abortion nationwide, only 12 percent of obstetrics and gynecology residency programs at the time included abortion training. "
