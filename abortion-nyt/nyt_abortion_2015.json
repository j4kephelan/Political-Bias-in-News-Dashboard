    "2015 - 413": "Despite a near-universal assumption that the Supreme Court will take up an abortion case in its new term, the general chatter hasn\u2019t included much detail about the specific issue, the stakes or the prospects. This column is an effort to address those questions. The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher, either for women who live in the growing number of states governed by anti-abortion politicians or for the court itself.",
    "2015 - 414": "In the wake of the Robert Dear shootings at a Planned Parenthood facility in Colorado, the tendency from pro-choice writers has been to get the pro-life movement coming and going\u00a0\u2014 on the one hand accusing pro-lifers of at least semi-deliberately fomenting violence, on the other accusing them of being inconsistent for abjuring the violence that their own premises seem (to pro-choice eyes) to inevitably justify.",
    "2015 - 440": "HERE are some things abortion opponents have said about Robert L. Dear Jr., the shooter accused of killing three and wounding nine at the Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs last Friday. He was just a lunatic. He wasn\u2019t attacking Planned Parenthood, he ran in there after trying to rob a bank. My personal favorite, from the Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz: He is reported to be a \u201ctransgendered leftist activist.\u201d",
    "2015 - 480": "House Republicans called for an investigation of Planned Parenthood this summer, after a series of deceptively edited videos issued by an anti-abortion group, the Center for Medical Progress, alleged that Planned Parenthood profits from the sale of tissue from fetuses. But at a hearing on Tuesday, members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee deluged Cecile Richards, Planned Parenthood\u2019s president, with a variety of questions entirely unrelated to that issue.",
    "2015 - 543": "A YEAR ago, a mother and self-described \u201cGod-fearing woman\u201d called me after she had an abortion. She said that earlier, when she found herself unexpectedly pregnant, she drove straight to what she thought was a comprehensive health care provider near her home in Columbus, Ohio. When she asked about abortion, the staff told her she shouldn\u2019t murder her child. Ohio requires an ultrasound before an abortion, so the woman listened to the staff\u2019s condemnations, taking them to heart, crying. She told me later, \u201cI didn\u2019t know where else to go.\u201d",
    "2015 - 546": "After the fatal shootings at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood clinic on Nov. 27, the model Chrissy Teigen responded almost immediately. A growing activist who has donated food for protesters in Ferguson, Mo., and verbally sparred with Donald J. Trump, she told her million-plus followers on Twitter that every time such incidents happen, \u201cJohn and I immediately make another donation to Planned Parenthood,\u201d referring to her husband, the singer John Legend, who then tweeted out his support of his wife\u2019s stance to his 7.4 million followers.",
    "2015 - 587": "There has been an impressive\u00a0amount of angry liberal commentary, which has spilled over into the mainstream press coverage (or do I repeat myself?) of the issue, about how in the last Republican presidential debate Carly Fiorina allegedly cited\u00a0an entirely imaginary video in order to make a crazy claim about Planned Parenthood\u2019s brain-harvesting ghoulishness that\u2019s totally unsupported by the facts.\u00a0Here\u2019s Slate\u2019s Dahlia Lithwick, in a representative rant, attacking\u00a0Fiorina\u2019s \u201cbig fib,\u201d the sheer \u201cenormity\u201d of which has shaken Lithwick\u2019s faith in honesty in politics and journalism:",
    "2015 - 831": "In addition to the inevitable\u00a0abortion politicking, the murderous rampage of Robert Dear\u00a0at a Planned Parenthood facility in Colorado has inspired a\u00a0number of writers\u00a0to contrast the stiff upper lip with which many Americans seem to\u00a0handle the general prevalence of gun violence\u00a0on our shores with the highly-politicized anxiety surrounding the acts that we decide to call \u201cterrorism.\u201d This contrast is widely invoked as evidence of American xenophobia: We fear attacks from a nebulous or specifically-Islamic \u201cOther\u201d more than we fear violence by angry white men, it\u2019s alleged, even if the Other isn\u2019t likely to\u00a0hurt us nearly as much as a bunch of heavily-armed heartlanders, because Americans still\u00a0identify with\u00a0whiteness/maleness/Christianity\u00a0too closely to fully imagine \u201cwhite Christian terrorism\u201d as something to be feared.",
    "2015 - 1045": "Abortion opponents have been quick to distance themselves from the Nov. 27 shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, which left three people dead. The anti-abortion groups lining up to condemn the violence included the Center for Medical Progress, which released videos in July accusing Planned Parenthood of selling fetal parts and tissue. Planned Parenthood denied making sales, saying one of its 700 health centers was being reimbursed for supplying fetal tissue to researchers, who have used fetal cells to produce lifesaving vaccines and treatments. But the doctor caught on camera spoke in graphic medical terms while sipping wine over lunch, and the videos prompted five separate congressional investigations into Planned Parenthood\u2019s practices. Testifying before a House committee in October, the group\u2019s president, Cecile Richards, said it would continue facilitating the tissue donations, with patients\u2019 consent, but stop accepting reimbursements. The Center for Medical Progress called this \u201can admission of guilt.\u201d",
    "2015 - 1217": "An investigation into whether three Planned Parenthood clinics had improperly sold fetal tissue found that they had not, but said that they disposed of aborted fetuses improperly by turning them over to disposal companies that take the remains to landfills, the state attorney general, Mike DeWine, said Friday. Mr. DeWine said that sending aborted fetuses to a landfill was \u201ccallous and completely inhumane\u201d and violated a state administrative code requirement that fetuses be disposed of \u201cin a humane manner.\u201d He referred his findings to the Ohio Department of Health, which oversees abortion clinics. Stephanie Kight, the president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, issued a statement calling the accusations \u201cinflammatory and baseless.\u201d She said Planned Parenthood \u201chandles medical tissue like any other quality health care provider. Our agreements with vendors all require them to follow state law, and dispose of tissue accordingly. If they are not, then I will take swift action.\u201d Ms. Kight said she was concerned that the attorney general\u2019s report was \u201cnot the result of meaningful investigation, but instead yet another attack on women\u2019s access to health care in the state of Ohio.\u201d "
