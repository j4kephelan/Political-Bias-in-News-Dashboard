    "2013 - 7650": "BOSTON \u2014 The two brothers suspected of bombing the Boston Marathon appear to have been motivated by their religious faith but do not seem connected to any Muslim terrorist groups, U.S. officials said Monday after interrogating the severely wounded younger man. He was charged with federal crimes that could bring the death penalty.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, was charged in his hospital room with using a weapon of mass destruction to kill. He was accused of joining with his older brother, Tamerlan \u2014 now dead \u2014 in setting off the pressure-cooker bombs that killed three people and wounded more than 200 a week ago.<p style=\" margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; display: block;\"> <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/137455967/Tsarnaev-Transcript\" style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" title=\"View Tsarnaev Transcript on Scribd\">Tsarnaev Transcript</a> by <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/nypost\" style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" title=\"View New York Post's profile on Scribd\">New York Post</a><iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.772922022279349\" data-auto-height=\"false\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250\" id=\"doc_34296\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://www.scribd.com/embeds/137455967/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;access_key=key-1fsfclzzqmj1lk2097xa\" width=\"525\"></iframe>\nThe brothers, ethnic Chechens from Russia who had been living in the U.S. for about a decade, practiced Islam.Two U.S. officials said preliminary evidence from an interrogation suggests the brothers were motivated by religion but were apparently not tied to any Islamic terrorist organizations. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the investigation.The criminal complaint containing the charges against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev shed no light on the motive.ut it gave a detailed sequence of events and cited surveillance-camera images of him dropping off a knapsack with one of the bombs and using a cellphone, perhaps to coordinate or detonate the blasts.<a class=\"legacy-link\">WIDOW OF ALLEGED BOSTON BOMBER FACES FBI\u2019S HEAT</a>\n<a class=\"legacy-link\">BOSTON GETS BACK TO NORMAL AFTER MANHUNT, MARATHON ATTACK</a>\n<a class=\"legacy-link\">MOURNERS SAY FINAL GOODBYES TO MARATHON VICTIM KRYSTLE CAMPBELL</a>\nThe Massachusetts college student was listed in serious but stable condition at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center with a gunshot wound to the throat and other injuries. His 26-year-old brother died last week in a fierce gunbattle with police.\u201cAlthough our investigation is ongoing, today\u2019s charges bring a successful end to a tragic week for the city of Boston and for our country,\u201d Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement.The charges carry the death penalty or a prison sentence of up to life.\u201cHe has what\u2019s coming to him,\u201d a wounded Kaitlynn Cates said from her hospital room. She was at the finish line when the first blast knocked her off her feet, and she suffered an injury to her lower leg.In outlining the evidence against him in court papers, the FBI said Tsarnaev was seen on surveillance cameras putting a knapsack down on the ground near the site of the second blast and then manipulating a cellphone and lifting it to his ear.Seconds later, the first explosion went off about a block down the street and spread fear and confusion through the crowd. But Tsarnaev \u2014 unlike nearly everyone around him \u2014 looked calm and quickly walked away, the FBI said.Just 10 seconds or so later, the second blast occurred where he had left the knapsack, the FBI said.The FBI did not make it clear whether authorities believe he used his cellphone to detonate one or both of the bombs or whether he was talking to someone.The court papers also said that during the long night of crime Thursday and Friday that led to the older brother\u2019s death and the younger one\u2019s capture, one of the Tsarnaev brothers told a carjacking victim: \u201cDid you hear about the Boston explosion? I did that.\u201dIn addition to the federal charges, the younger Tsarnaev brother is also likely to face state charges in connection with the shooting death of an MIT police officer.The Obama administration said it had no choice but to prosecute Tsarnaev in the federal court system. Some politicians had suggested he be tried as an enemy combatant in front of a military tribunal, where defendants are denied some of the usual U.S. constitutional protections.But Tsarnaev is a naturalized U.S. citizen, and under U.S. law, American citizens cannot be tried by military tribunals, White House spokesman Jay Carney said. Carney said that since 9/11, the federal court system has been used to convict and imprison hundreds of terrorists.In its criminal complaint, the FBI said it searched Tsarnaev\u2019s dorm room at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth on Sunday and found BBs as well as a white hat and dark jacket that look like those worn by one of one of the suspected bombers in the surveillance photos the FBI released a few days after the attack.Seven days after the bombings, meanwhile, Boston was bustling Monday, with runners hitting the pavement, children walking to school and enough cars clogging the streets to make the morning commute feel almost back to normal.Residents paused in the afternoon to observe a moment of silence at 2:50 p.m., the time of the first blast. Church bells tolled across the city and state in tribute to the victims.Standing on the steps of the state Capitol, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick bowed his head and said after the moment of silence: \u201cGod bless the people of Massachusetts. Boston Strong.\u201dOn Boylston Street, where the bombing took place, the silence was broken when a Boston police officer pumped his fists in the air and the crowd erupted in applause. The crowd then quietly sang \u201cGod Bless America.\u201dAlso, hundreds of family and friends packed a church in Medford for the funeral of bombing victim Krystle Campbell, a 29-year-old restaurant worker. A memorial service was scheduled for Monday night at Boston University for 23-year-old Lu Lingzi, a graduate student from China.Fifty-one victims remained hospitalized Monday, three of them in critical condition.At the Snowden International School on Newbury Street, a high school set just a block from the bombing site, jittery parents dropped off children as teachers \u2014 some of whom had run in the race \u2014 greeted each other with hugs.Carlotta Martin of Boston said that leaving her kids at school has been the hardest part of getting back to normal.\u201cWe\u2019re right in the middle of things,\u201d Martin said outside the school as her children, 17-year-old twins and a 15-year-old, walked in, glancing at the police barricades a few yards from the school\u2019s front door.\u201cI\u2019m nervous. Hopefully, this stuff is over,\u201d she continued. \u201cI told my daughter to text me so I know everything\u2019s OK.\u201dTsarnaev was captured Friday night after an intense all-day manhunt that brought the Boston area to a near-standstill. He was cornered and seized, wounded and bloody, after he was discovered hiding in a tarp-covered boat in a Watertown backyard.He had apparent gunshot wounds to the head, neck, legs and hand, the FBI said in court papers.Meanwhile, investigators in the Boston suburb of Waltham are looking into whether there are links between Tamerlan Tsarnaev and an unsolved 2011 slaying. Tsarnaev was a friend of one of three men found dead in an apartment with their necks slit and their bodies reportedly covered with marijuana.",

    "2013 - 4122": "The Boston Marathon bombers set off their deadly explosives with a simple device found in a kid\u2019s toy box \u2014 a remote control for a play car, it was revealed yesterday.The remote, which included a transmitter powered by a rechargeable \u201cC\u201d battery, was found among the debris of the pressure-cooker bombs planted by brothers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, said Congressman Dutch Ruppersberger.The Maryland Democrat said the FBI revealed the detonation system during a briefing about the April 15 attack, which killed three and injured more than 200.\u201cIt was a remote control for toy cars,\u201d Ruppersberger said. \u201cWhich says to me . . . they got the information on how to build the bomb from Inspire magazine.\u201dInspire, an English-language online magazine published by al Qaeda, was cited by Dzhokhar, 19, as a blueprint for the bombs. It published an article on pressure-cooker bombs in 2010 called \u201cHow to Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom.\u201d Also yesterday:* Before the terror blasts, CIA officials warned the FBI that Tamerlan was meeting with \u201csome seriously dangerous people in Russia and he was ready to become a jihadist,\u201d a law-enforcement source told The Post yesterday.CIA officials also asked the FBI to place Tamerlan on an international terror watch list, which was done. But, despite the warnings, no red flags were raised when Tamerlan returned from Russia and he was let back into the United States.* NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly said that Dzhokhar, from his Boston hospital bed, told authorities that after the bombings he and Tamerlan planned to go to New York City \u201cto party.\u201d Their post-bombing escape plan was thwarted when Tamerlan was killed in a police shootout early Friday, and Dzhokhar was nabbed that night.* The brothers\u2019 parents \u2014 who have claimed their sons could not have committed the attack \u2014 said they will travel from the Russian Republic of Dagestan to the United States today. Yesterday, US investigators interviewed the mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaev, in Dagestan. She is wanted for allegedly jumping bail on shoplifting charges.* Vice President Joe Biden, speaking at a memorial service for MIT cop Sean Collier \u2014 whom the Tsarnaevs killed last Friday \u2014 called the brothers \u201ctwo twisted, perverted, cowardly, knockoff jihadis here in Boston.\u201d* The area around the marathon finish line on Boston\u2019s Boylston Street \u2014 which had been closed off since the attack \u2014 reopened, with fresh concrete poured over the damaged sidewalk.* It was revealed that Katherine Russell, Tamerlan\u2019s Muslim-convert wife, was arrested in 2007 for swiping goods from a Warwick, RI, Old Navy store. The case was dismissed after she completed community service.* Neil Diamond will donate proceeds from his song \u201cSweet Caroline\u201d to victims of the bombing after sales of the Fenway Park anthem soared nearly 600 percent this week.* Dzhokhar\u2019s classmates at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth told the Boston Globe that he sold pot, and that his dorm room reeked of marijuana.* Officials said yesterday that there was no gun recovered from the boat where Dzhokhar was hiding in Watertown, Mass. Authorities had previously said Dzhokhar had exchanged gunfire with them in the dramatic capture. CIA warnings about Tamerlan prompted inquiries as to whether he should have been under more intense scrutiny.\u201cWe\u2019re going to get to the bottom of it,\u201d vowed House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), saying hearings would be held on how federal agencies handled the warnings. \u201cI think we want to understand exactly what happened and what didn\u2019t happen and hold those responsible if in fact there were opportunities to stop these people when we didn\u2019t do it.\u201dIn Russia, mom Zubeidat told CNN, \u201cIf they are going to kill [Dzhokhar], I don\u2019t care.\u201dAccording to Fox News, the FBI claims Tamerlan sent text messages to his mother vowing to die for Islam.Investigators say Dzhokhar has told them he willingly followed Tamerlan\u2019s lead in planning and executing the bombings. But officials said yesterday those statements were made before the suspect was read his rights.<em>Additional reporting by Kirstan Conley and Geoff Earle</em>",
