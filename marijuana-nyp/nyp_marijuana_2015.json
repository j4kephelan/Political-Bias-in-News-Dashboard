    "2015 - 5948": "STEPHENVILLE, Texas \u2014\u00a0A Texas jury has rejected the insanity defense of a former Marine in the deaths of famed <a href=\"https://nypost.com/tag/american-sniper/\">\u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d</a> author <a href=\"https://nypost.com/tag/chris-kyle/\">Chris Kyle</a> and another man.After a two-week trial in which jurors heard testimony about defendant <a href=\"https://nypost.com/tag/eddie-ray-routh/\">Eddie Ray Routh\u2019s</a> erratic behavior, including statements about anarchy, the apocalypse and pig-human hybrids, they convicted Routh Tuesday night in the deaths of Kyle and Chad Littlefield at a Texas shooting range two years ago.Routh showed no reaction as a judge sentenced him to life in prison without parole, an automatic sentence since prosecutors didn\u2019t seek the death penalty in the capital murder case. As one of his victim\u2019s siblings called him an \u201cAmerican disgrace\u201d shortly after, Routh looked back at the man intensely but didn\u2019t react otherwise.The verdict capped an emotional trial in which prosecutors painted the 27-year-old as a troubled drug user who knew right from wrong, despite any mental illnesses. Defense attorneys said he suffered from schizophrenia and was suffering a psychotic episode at the time of the shootings. While trial testimony and evidence often included Routh making odd statements and referring to insanity, he also confessed several times, apologized for the crimes and tried to evade police after the crime.\u201cYou took the lives of two heroes, men who tried to be a friend to you,\u201d Chad Littlefield\u2019s half-brother Jerry Richardson told Routh after the verdict. \u201cAnd you became an American disgrace.\u201d<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"youtube-player\" height=\"360\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/99k3u9ay1gs?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" style=\"border:0;\" title=\"Video\" width=\"640\"></iframe></span>Routh\u2019s trial drew intense interest, in part because of the blockbuster film based on former Navy SEAL Kyle\u2019s memoir about his four tours in Iraq.Jurors had three options: find Routh guilty of capital murder, find him not guilty, or find him not guilty by reason of insanity. Had he been found not guilty by reason of insanity, the court could have initiated proceedings to have him committed to a state mental hospital.\u201cWe\u2019re so thrilled that we have the verdict that we have tonight,\u201d Littlefield\u2019s mother, Judy Littlefield, said at a news conference outside the courthouse.The Littlefield family had waited \u201ctwo years for God to get justice for us,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was faithful.\u201dKyle\u2019s widow, Taya Kyle, had left the courtroom during the defense\u2019s closing statements earlier in the day and had not returned when the verdict was read. Chris Kyle\u2019s brother and parents were among a group hugging and crying inside the courtroom after the verdict was read. They did not issue a statement.Richardson and Littlefield\u2019s father, Don Littlefield, were the only two people to give statements in court, speaking directly to Routh. Don Littlefield told Routh that even though his son never served in the military, he was honored to help those who did. \u201cHe was trying to help you,\u201d he told Routh.Kyle and Littlefield had taken Routh to the shooting range at Rough Creek Lodge and Resort on Feb. 2, 2013, after Routh\u2019s mother asked Kyle to help her troubled son. Family members say Routh suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder from serving in Iraq and in Haiti after the devastating 2010 earthquake.However, Richardson told Routh that Routh\u2019s PTSD claims \u201chave been an insult to every veteran who served with honor.\u201dRouth\u2019s mother, Jodi Routh, who was questioned by prosecutors about why she didn\u2019t tell Kyle about the extent of her son\u2019s mental troubles, sat expressionless as well in the courtroom as the verdict was read.Routh\u2019s defense team said they would appeal the conviction.A forensic psychologist testified for prosecutors that Routh <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2015/02/20/psychologist-testifies-american-sniper-killer-is-not-insane/\">was not legally insane</a> and suggested he may have gotten some of his ideas from television. Dr. Randall Price said Routh had a paranoid disorder made worse by his use of alcohol and marijuana, calling his condition \u201ccannabis-induced psychosis.\u201dDefense attorneys noted that <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2015/02/11/prosecutor-attacks-accused-sniper-killers-insanity-defense/\">Kyle had described Routh as \u201cstraight-up nuts\u201d</a> in a text message to Littlefield as they drove to the luxury resort. They said Routh, who had been prescribed<a href=\"https://nypost.com/2015/02/19/american-sniper-killer-has-schizophrenia-psychiatrist/\"> anti-psychotic medication often used for schizophrenia</a>, believed the men planned to kill him.Asked by a reporter for The New Yorker magazine in a jailhouse call if he thought about the day he shot the men, Routh replied, \u201cIt tore my (expletive) heart out when I did it,\u201d later adding, \u201cI guess you live and you learn, you know.\u201dA resort employee discovered the bodies of Kyle and Littlefield about 5 p.m.; each had been shot several times. About 45 minutes later, authorities say, Routh pulled up to his sister\u2019s home in Kyle\u2019s truck and told her he had killed two people.She called police, who later located Routh sitting in front of his home in the truck. A police video shown by prosecutors showed officers trying to coax him from the truck while he makes comments including \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going insane,\u201d and, \u201cIs this about hell walking on Earth right now?\u201d\u201cHe told us he\u2019d taken a couple of souls and he had more souls to take,\u201d Lancaster police Lt. Michael Smith testified.Routh later took off and led authorities on a chase before the truck became disabled and he was arrested.",

I don\u2019t need to take feminist life lessons from a pampered, privileged harpy.The old trope that females in this country make, on average, about 77 cents for every dollar earned by men has been debunked repeatedly, most recently in a study by the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research. It found that New York state\u2019s female millennials \u2014 those who became adults around the year 2000 \u2014 earned $1.02 for every buck brought in by young men.In the rest of the nation, the supposed pay gap about disappears when you compare people who do similar work, such as waiters to waitresses and corporate honchos to corporate honchos.If a worker\u2019s education level is factored in, and if you consider that some women simply choose to step off the fast lane in order to raise families, the difference in pay vanishes, studies have shown.Female pay inequity is \u201ca tired clich\u00e9,\u2019\u2019 Carrie Lukas, managing director of the Independent Women\u2019s Forum, a conservative think tank, told me. \u201cIt can hurt women by perpetuating the idea that women are victims of systematic discrimination \u2014 we\u2019re all doomed to failure.\u201cThat\u2019s not what you want your daughters to hear.\u2019\u2019Females in Hollywood have a problem.As hacked emails from within Sony Pictures reveal, actresses Amy Adams, 40, and Jennifer Lawrence, 24 \u2014 who won an Oscar for Best Actress in a Leading Role for 2012\u2019s \u201cSilver Linings Playbook\u2019\u2019 \u2014 were paid less than their male co-stars for their roles in the 2013 flick \u201cAmerican Hustle.\u2019\u2019 This is a terrible injustice.

    "2015 - 6693": "MEXICO CITY \u2014 Servando \u201cLa Tuta\u201d Gomez, one of the most-wanted drug lords and who once terrorized western Michoacan state, was captured early Friday by federal police, according to a Mexican official.He was arrested in the capital city of Morelia without a shot fired, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case.Gomez was the leader of the Knights Templar cartel, a quasi-religious criminal group that once ruled all of the state, controlling politics and commerce. He evaded capture for more than a year after the federal government took over the state to try to restore order.Known countrywide as \u201cLa Tuta,\u201d Gomez rose from schoolteacher to one of Mexico\u2019s most ruthless and wanted cartel leaders, dominating for a time Mexico\u2019s lucrative methamphetamine trade and taking control of his home state through extortion, intimidation and coercion of business and political leaders.Thought it started in drugs, his gang even took over the state\u2019s international port, Lazaro Cardenas, and made millions from illegal mining of ore.Gomez was a talkative and public cartel leader, a rarity among capos known for keeping their silence. He gave a British television crew an interview in January even as the government was mounting a major assault on his gang that eventually led to its demise. He told the reporter that his illegal work was all about business.\u201cAs we told you, we are a necessary evil,\u201d Gomez is seen telling a group of townspeople on tape. \u201cUnfortunately or fortunately, we are here. If we weren\u2019t, another group would come.\u201dGomez\u2019s long reign was untouched by several attempts by the federal government to send troops and police to regain control of the state, and only began to unravel when a band of vigilantes decided in early 2013 to take up arms and do what the local government wouldn\u2019t.The \u201cself-defense\u201d groups \u2014 some of the members farmers and ranchers, others alleged rivals and former cartel members \u2014 marched through the Knights\u2019 territory, taking town after town and finally forcing the federal government in late 2013 to mount a real offensive to find Gomez and other Knights Templar leaders.Gomez accused them of being sent by a rival cartel in neighboring Jalisco state.In truculent videotaped statements, Gomez regularly accused the federal government of supporting his rivals and offered to strike peace deals with authorities. The celebrated outlaw popped up often either haranguing his troops over radio frequencies or phoning in to a local TV or radio station.The only other fugitive drug lord known to speak to the press is Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada, the co-leader of the Sinaloa cartel who has granted a single interview.Born Feb. 6, 1966, Gomez started as a grade-school teacher in the Michoacan hill town of Arteaga, and was still listed on a payroll at a school there, at least until 2009. Hence his additional nickname of \u201cEl Profe\u201d \u2014 the Professor.In his hometown, some residents praised him as a humble man who ambled about in sandals and would give poorer people money for food, clothing and medical care when they were in a jam. They said he mediated disputes such as a traffic accident or child support battles.Gomez apparently started out transporting marijuana before becoming in the mid-2000s a top leader of La Familia, another cult-like cartel and predecessor of his Knights Templar. He continued his populist tendencies while acting as a sort of de facto spokesman for that gang, which was led by Nazario \u201cEl Chayo\u201d Moreno Gonzalez, Jesus \u201cEl Chango\u201d (the Monkey) Mendez Vargas and Dionicio \u201cEl Tio\u201d (the Uncle) Loya.La Familia initially portrayed itself as a crusader gang, protecting communities from the Zetas cartel. Witnesses say La Familia trained its recruits in ultra-violent techniques like beheading and dismembering victims, and it frequently ambushed soldiers and federal police.A US Justice Department indictment in 2009 said Gomez might be behind the murder of 12 Mexican federal law enforcement officers whose bodies were found in July of that year while he still operated under La Familia.After the government claimed that the cartel\u2019s top leader, Moreno, had been killed in a shootout with police in late 2010, the gang weakened. One faction sought help from its old foe, the Zetas. Gomez turned on his old bosses and started the Knights Templar. Many claimed he continued to work with Moreno, who they said was not dead. Authorities never found his body.As the leader of the Knights Templar, Gomez claimed he was a \u201chigh-class\u201d criminal. He issued pocket-size booklets that were distributed in buses in 2011 as the cartel sought to create a social base. The \u201ccode of conduct\u201d claimed it was fighting a war against poverty, tyranny and injustice, while being blamed for murders, extortion and drug trafficking.In an interview with MundoFox, News Corp.\u2019s Spanish-language network, Gomez acknowledged he had committed many crimes but said he never killed an innocent person. He also said he was not scared of dying, because he would choose being killed over going to jail.His videotaped speeches hit hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube. One of them shows him sitting at a desk. On the wall behind are portraits of Ernesto \u201cChe\u201d Guevara, Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa and Mexico\u2019s flag. On the table is the manifesto of Moreno.In his speeches, Gomez seemed fearless and daring, but rambled cynically about his quest to give money to the poor while brutally punishing his foes. He often came off preachy and messianic.Gomez accused the government of losing sight of the rule of law in Michoacan.Gomez called the Knights Templar a \u201cbrotherhood,\u201d and boasted of its Robin Hood-like quality, saying the gang\u2019s members were born to protect the people and give them back what was rightly theirs.The folksy and charismatic cartel leader of puffy cheeks and large nose, known to wear a baseball cap and a gray goatee, was a fugitive also wanted in the United States for conspiracy to import and distribute cocaine.Associating with Gomez made for national scandals.Gomez accused federal Sen. Luisa Maria Calderon, sister of then-President Felipe Calderon, of seeking his support through a staff worker when she ran for governor of Michoacan in 2011. He showed a video of himself talking to a man who he said worked for Calderon, but her party said the man wasn\u2019t affiliated.A phone conversation between a federal congressman and the suspected trafficker was taped, leaked and then broadcast by a radio station, showing they expressed support for each other. The lawmaker, Cesar Godoy, was charged with aiding drug trafficking and money laundering and is now a fugitive.",

Several of the bales broke apart as they bounced on the pavement.Sheriff\u2019s Office spokesman Jim Knupp said Tuesday that 17 bales totaling 374 pounds of marijuana were recovered, and four or five vehicles were seen stopping to pick up the rest.The chase spanned Interstates 8 and 10 near Casa Grande in south-central Arizona and several local roads. It ended when the SUV pulled off a two-lane road and stopped after driving over tire-puncturing sticks.Two men were arrested on suspicion of marijuana trafficking offenses and fleeing police.The Sheriff\u2019s Office said the pursuit resulted from information gathered as a result of another chase in which a pickup truck was stopped earlier the same day. That stop led to the detention of nine people who were turned over to the U.S. Border Patrol, the office said.Citing the need to keep investigative procedures secret, Knupp declined to say how the information from the first chase led to the second."
