Everyone, and I mean everyone, should be aware of what they look like, how they\u2019ve been traveling and take the appropriate measures.\u201dThe duo are also suspected of killing Alicia Greer, 30, and Jacqueline Jeanette Moore, 39, whose bodies were found at a hotel in Milton on Jan. 31, as well as the death of Peggy Broz, 52, who was found shot in Lillian, Alabama, last Friday. Police have said Greer was in a relationship with Boyette, but the other victims have no known connection to the Bonnie and Clyde couple.Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan said the cases were \u201cdifficult\u201d to speak about due to their random nature, at least pertaining to the two most recent victims.\u201cIt is difficult to speak about this, ladies and gentlemen, because these are the cases that we in law enforcement fear, where we have what is, apparently with the last two victims anyway, a random selection,\u201d Morgan told reporters Monday. \u201cAnd so therefore, much to our disappointment and primarily to our frustration, you know, we\u2019re chasing a lot of shadows and a lot of rumors.\u201dMorgan said Boyette and Rice \u2013 who also stole Broz\u2019s white 2003 Chrysler Concorde \u2013 have managed to stay mobile. Deputies have been searching a wooded area near Nine Mile Road after surveillance footage showed them in the area on Monday. Investigators are also scouring possible encampments and are using canine teams during the searches, <a href=\"http://www.pnj.com/story/news/crime/2017/02/06/home-invasion-reported-beulah/97545014/\" target=\"_blank\">the Pensacola News Journal reports</a>.\u2018In short, we have a killer and he is in our midst, has been in our midst.

So again, in law enforcement we take those threats and those admonitions very seriously.\u201dA spokeswoman for the sheriff\u2019s department told The Post that the manhunt for Boyette and Rice was ongoing as of early Tuesday. The pair\u2019s exact relationship remains unclear, but Morgan said investigators are treating her as a suspect instead of a possible kidnapping victim because she had opportunities to \u201cmake an escape, to walk away\u201d from Boyette and even dyed her hair orange.\u201cBut she has returned continually to him,\u201d Morgan told reporters. \u201cSo at this point in time, we upgraded her status, if you will, and she will be treated as a suspect with any contact with law enforcement.\u201dCrocker, meanwhile, remained in critical condition early Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/02/07/running-nightmare-couple-on-gulf-coast-killing-spree-have-killed-3-injured-one-police-say/?utm_term=.8e56eb2bf35c\" target=\"_blank\">the Washington Post reports</a>.

    "2017 - 5229": "DENVER \u2014 At risk of raising the ire of the White House, Colorado is on the brink of becoming the first state with licensed pot clubs. But the details of how these clubs will operate are as hazy as the underground clubs operating already.Denver officials are working on regulations to open a one-year pilot of bring-your-own marijuana clubs, while state lawmakers are expected to consider measures to allow either marijuana \u201ctasting rooms\u201d run by marijuana dispensaries, or smoke-friendly clubs akin to cigar bars.Alaska regulators, spooked by how the Trump administration might view marijuana, recently decided not to move forward with rules for use of marijuana at authorized stores, though the issue there isn\u2019t dead.California and Maine voters <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2014/01/01/crowds-gather-as-pot-prohibition-ends-in-colorado/\">expressly signed off on public marijuana consumption</a> but haven\u2019t settled on rules. Oregon lawmakers are considering legislation to allow marijuana use at special events like concerts, and in cannabis lounges. But Colorado may be first out of the gate with statewide pot-club regulations, possibly by this summer.Colorado officials from both parties have come around to the idea of Amsterdam-style pot clubs for a simple reason: Everyone is tired of seeing pot smokers on public sidewalks.\u201cIt\u2019s a problem we\u2019ve got to address,\u201d said state Sen. Chris Holbert, a suburban Denver Republican who opposed marijuana legalization but doesn\u2019t like seeing its use on the sidewalk, either.Pointing jokingly to his suit and tie, the gray-haired Holbert said he\u2019s even had panhandlers ask him for marijuana near the state Capitol.\u201cI mean, look at me. If I\u2019m getting hassled, everyone\u2019s getting hassled,\u201d Holbert told reporters.Democrats here agree tourists need an out-of-sight place to use marijuana.\u201cNo voter in Colorado voted to allow the use of marijuana on their sidewalk, in their parks, in their public view,\u201d said Democratic state Rep. Dan Pabon of Denver. \u201cBut that\u2019s essentially what we\u2019ve done by not allowing private club space for marijuana uses.\u201dSo both parties seem to agree that Colorado needs to allow for places that let patrons smoke weed. But that\u2019s where agreement breaks down.A Republican-sponsored measure to allow marijuana clubs to be regulated like cigar bars was put on hold for a re-write. That\u2019s because sponsors are trying to address concerns that pot clubs shouldn\u2019t allow medical marijuana use, along with other legal wrinkles.Telling people to socially use their medicine? That\u2019s like we\u2019re legalizing pill parties,\u201d said Rachel O\u2019Bryan, who opposes marijuana clubs and ran an unsuccessful campaign to defeat a Denver social-use measure last fall.There\u2019s also intense disagreement over whether establishing pot clubs would invite a federal crackdown.Some say the clubs would be too much for federal authorities to ignore; others insist the Justice Department would view clubs as a way to keep pot away from children, a priority according to previous Justice Department directions.\u201cJeff Sessions is the big question mark right now,\u201d said Democratic state Rep. Jonathan Singer, referring to the newly minted, anti-marijuana U.S. attorney general. \u201cI think we need to send a message to him that Colorado\u2019s doing it right.\u201dGov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, opposed pot legalization but is undecided on signing a bill to allow clubs. He said he\u2019s not sure how the administration would respond to such establishments.\u201cI don\u2019t know whether we\u2019d be inviting federal intervention, but certainly that\u2019s one argument I\u2019ve heard used persuasively,\u201d Hickenlooper said Thursday.The governor did indicate he\u2019d veto a bill that allowed indoor smoking, not just smoking on enclosed private patios. The Denver clubs would have to abide by clean-air laws banning burned marijuana inside; the statewide proposal would allow indoor smoking with \u201cproper ventilation.\u201d\u201cWe spent a long time letting everyone know that smoking is bad for you,\u201d Hickenlooper said. \u201cJust cause that smoke makes you happy, and dumb, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s good for you.\u201d\u2018Just cause that smoke makes you happy, and dumb, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s good for you.\u2019The marijuana industry seems frustrated by Colorado\u2019s halting attempts to figure out how to allow pot clubs. Because current marijuana law is vague, Colorado currently has a patchwork of underground clubs, many of them raided when they try to file permits or pay taxes.\u201cThe situation right now is a disaster,\u201d said Chris Jetter, a licensed marijuana grower who owned a west Denver pot club that was raided twice. Jetter said authorities took more than six pounds of marijuana, along with tens of thousands in cash, then charged him with illegally distributing pot.(Jetter eventually pleaded guilty to public consumption of marijuana, and was fined $100. He disputes he was doing anything illegal and says he pleaded guilty to end the matter. He has since closed his club.)\u201cTwo or more people can get together and consume alcohol almost anywhere, and there\u2019s no problem with that,\u201d Jetter said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not treating marijuana like alcohol. What\u2019s going to happen with the feds? If they start kicking in doors, I don\u2019t know. But we need to figure something out.\u201d",
    "2017 - 3072": "A police veteran with 22 years on the force was told to \u201ctone down\u201d his sexuality if he ever wanted a promotion to lieutenant, according to a discrimination lawsuit.Sgt. Keith Wildhaber of the St. Louis County Police Department claimed in a lawsuit filed last month that he was passed over for promotion despite \u201cextremely positive feedback\u201d on his work performance and scores in an internal testing process that ranked him third out of 26 candidates during the application period in early 2014.Then, during a routine patrol checking on local restaurants, Wildhaber claims the owner of Bartolino\u2019s, John Saracino, who was also a member of the St. Louis County Police Board at the time, told him he knew of Wildhaber\u2019s recent application to move up the police ranks.\u201cMr. Saracino told [Wildhaber], \u2018The command staff has a problem with your sexuality,\u2019\u201d according to the lawsuit filed Jan. 10 in St. Louis County. \u201cIf you ever want to see a white shirt, [i.e., get a promotion], you should tone down your gayness.\u201dReached Wednesday by the St. Louis Dispatch, Saracino said: \u201cI never had a conversation like that. I would never say anything like that. That\u2019s not me.\u201dSaracino later resigned from the police board over a letter of support he asked Police Chief Jon Belmar to write to a federal judge who was sentencing his nephew for his involvement in a marijuana ring, <a href=\"http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/st-louis-county-cop-says-he-was-told-to-tone/article_a5afe909-771f-5726-8db9-5bdffe0ae1c1.html\" target=\"_blank\">the newspaper reported</a>.Officer Ben Granda, a department spokesman, declined comment, citing an \u201cactive lawsuit\u201d in an email on Friday to The Post.\u201cWhat we can say is that our main focus in recruiting and developing employees is looking for excellent individuals, no matter what their status, race, religion, sexual preference, political belief, or aspiration is,\u201d Granda said.Wildhaber, according to the lawsuit, has a clean disciplinary history, \u201cexcellent performance reviews\u201d and a strong resume supporting his promotion, but still has not been elevated to the rank of lieutenant.\u201cDefendant believes that Plaintiff\u2019s behavior, mannerism, and/or appearance do not fit the stereotypical norms of what a \u2018male\u2019 should be,\u201d according to the lawsuit, which alleges the department\u2019s gender-based expectations were at least a contributing factor in denying Wildhaber\u2019s promotion.Wildhaber, according to the lawsuit, joined the St. Louis County Police Department in 1994 after four years in the US Army. In 2011, he was promoted to sergeant after five years assigned to the detective bureau and he was once asked to serve as the department\u2019s liaison to the LGBT community, the Dispatch reports.Wildhaber\u2019s attorney, Russell Riggan, declined comment when reached Friday by The Post.\u201cUntil the case goes before a jury, we will allow the Petition to speak for itself,\u201d Riggan wrote in an email. \u201cOur system of justice provides the right to a fair trial, and we do not wish to compromise our client\u2019s rights by commenting to the media.\u201d",
    "2017 - 3673": "Aaron Hernandez\u2019s game plan to beat one of two first-degree murder raps might include a marijuana Hail Mary.That\u2019s according to Boston Herald legal columnist and reporter Bob McGovern, who notes that included in a list of potential witnesses are two unidentified experts whom attorneys for the former New England Patriots tight end may call at his trial, which is expected to start next week.One of the experts may be called to testify on \u201cmarijuana use in the NFL, while another might address the \u201cmedical and psychological impacts for people who ingest marijuana\u201d and if there\u2019s any connection between using pot and violence.\u201cSometimes these experts get on the stand and say that based on their testing and review of the evidence that they don\u2019t believe the defendant had the mental ability to form an intent to kill,\u201d Robert Sheketoff, a longtime criminal defense attorney who is not involved in the case, <a href=\"http://www.bostonherald.com/news/columnists/bob_mcgovern/2017/02/mcgovern_aaron_hernandez_eyes_potential_pot_defense\" target=\"_blank\">told the Boston Herald</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s not a full defense, but it negates something the commonwealth has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201dHernandez\u2019s affinity for marijuana was integral in his first murder trial, in which he was <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2015/02/26/aaron-hernandez-danced-toked-ran-up-bar-tab-on-night-of-slay/\">convicted of killing Odin Lloyd</a>, a semi-pro football player, in June 2013. According to testimony from the trial, Hernandez ran up a $243 bar tab and smoked pot in the hours before Lloyd \u2014 the boyfriend of his\u00a0fiancee\u2019s sister \u2014 was shot to death.McGovern notes that Lloyd \u2013 who was called the \u201cblunt master\u201d by one of Hernandez\u2019s former attorneys \u2013 was Hernandez\u2019s source for marijuana, which he would at times smoke up to an ounce per day.Attorneys for Hernandez \u2013 who is already serving a life sentence for killing Lloyd \u2013 characterized the disgraced NFL star and Lloyd as \u201csmoke buddies,\u201d according to McGovern, questioning why he would want to cut off his source.But Hernandez\u2019s new defense team, which includes lead attorney Jose Baez \u2013 who gained notoriety for his defense of Casey Anthony \u2013 will likely use his excessive pot use as a backdrop to show he had a diminished capacity when he allegedly gunned down Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado in a drive-by shooting in 2012.\u201cAt that point, if you are using this tactic, you are probably trying to get it down to second-degree murder or manslaughter,\u201d Phil Tracy, a criminal defense attorney not involved in the case, told the Boston Herald. \u201cYou would try to say that repeated and prolonged use of marijuana had an effect on his brain so he couldn\u2019t form clear intent to commit first-degree murder.\u201dHernandez\u2019s attorneys will also likely stress the fact that prosecutors are without forensic evidence and a key eyewitness\u2019 checkered past could ultimately make him unreliable. There\u2019s even a possibility that Hernandez\u2019s attorneys could try to blame that eyewitness, Alexander Bradley, for the crime, the Boston Herald reports.Meanwhile, some notable NFL names may also <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2017/02/22/bill-belichick-may-be-a-witness-in-aaron-hernandez-trial/\">join the courtroom as potential defense witnesses</a> in Hernandez\u2019s trial, including New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick, offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels and former Florida teammate and current Steelers lineman Maurkice Pouncey.Belichick coached Hernandez for three years and signed him to a five-year, $40 million extension \u2014 one of the biggest contracts in Patriots history \u2014 before releasing him when he was connected to the Lloyd murder in 2013.",
