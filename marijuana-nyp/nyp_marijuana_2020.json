    "2020 - 3206": "A Michigan man serving up to 60 years in prison for selling 3 pounds of marijuana to an undercover informant is pleading for clemency \u2014 a desperate bid to avoid what supporters say amounts to a \u201clife sentence.\u201dMichael Alonzo Thompson, 68, has spent more than 25 years in prison after being convicted of selling pot and possessing firearms as a felon in Genesee County in December 1994, according to a website seeking his immediate release.\u201cHe has been in prison ever since,\u201d the <a href=\"https://www.freemichaelthompson.com/\">site reads</a>. \u201cIt has been 25 years. And he still has 35 years left to serve \u2026 In other words, he was given a life sentence for selling weed.\u201dThompson\u2019s earliest release date from the Muskegon Correctional Facility is in April 2038, but he could be kept behind bars until February 2047 \u2014 some 53 years after the 1994 crime. His maximum sentence is listed as 60 years, according to prison records.Thompson\u2019s attorney, Kimberly Kendall Corral, said she submitted a petition of clemency Wednesday on his behalf to the Michigan Department of Corrections Parole Board, his third attempt. His last request for release was denied by then-Gov. Rick Snyder in 2018 \u2014 the same year Michigan voted to legalize recreational marijuana in the state.A copy was also sent overnight to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who cannot make a recommendation until after the parole board determines whether commutation of Thompson\u2019s sentence is warranted, Corral said.\u201cThis is his third application for commutation,\u201d Corral told The Post. \u201cThe issue we ran into this case was not less egregious than it was two years ago when Gov. Snyder denied it.\u201dMore than 21,000 people had signed Thompson\u2019s clemency petition as of Thursday. A message seeking comment from Whitmer\u2019s office was referred to the state\u2019s parole board. A spokesman for that agency did not immediately return a message Thursday afternoon.\u201cBy the end of 2021 recreational weed is projected to be a $1.5 billion industry in Michigan,\u201d Thompson\u2019s website reads. \u201cBut Michael has literally spent almost half of his life in prison for selling weed. It has cost the state of Michigan over a million dollars to keep him there.\u201dThe length of Thompson\u2019s sentence is attributable to his prior drug-related felony convictions, a Michigan Department of Corrections spokesman <a href=\"https://www.wzzm13.com/article/news/crime/michael-thompson-whitmer/69-326c0f75-b31a-4ae7-a23a-e6f3b2ccfc65\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">told WZZM</a>.\u201cThey were able to charge him as a habitual offender, which means they can add on increased years to his sentence,\u201d spokesman Chris Gautz said.Gautz said Thompson has been a model prisoner, citing only two minor infractions in the last quarter-century.\u201cSome prisoners, who maybe aren\u2019t as well adjusted, might have two tickets in a week, so to only have two in two decades is a pretty small number,\u201d Gautz told the station.Thompson\u2019s attorney, meanwhile, said her client is hopeful but has reservations because the criminal justice system has failed him many times before, she said.\u201cNot everyone is super hopeful,\u201d Corral said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen so many injustices that it\u2019s hard to trust the system to work like it\u2019s intended.\u201d",
