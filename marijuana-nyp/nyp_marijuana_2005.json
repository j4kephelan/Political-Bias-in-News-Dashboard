A classmate at IS 59 in Jamaica alerted authorities about the gun, which the boy said he brought to show to a friend, according to sources.  \u201cHe told school safety officers, \u2018I had this at home,\u2019 and when we searched there, we found more ammunition, drugs and a samurai sword \u2013 so everybody got arrested,\u201d a source said.

Life without you is empty and meaningless,\u201d read the ad from \u201cLarry\u201d from Orlando to \u201cMarianne,\u201d his wife of 17 years, in the Florida Times-Union.   No response from Marianne yet, but Jay Weimar, director of the paper\u2019s display advertising, said, \u201cWe are pulling for him.\u201d   *  Students at Duke University study hard \u2013 and party hard.   Cops investigating a noise complaint found a basement full of 200 kids \u2013 many half-naked coeds \u2013 a rubber pool and gallons of baby oil.   \u201cInside were several [representatives of] America\u2019s future, re-enacting a scene from the movie \u2018Old School,\u2019 where females wrestle in a pool of lubricants,\u201d said Durham, N.C., police Sgt.

Cops in Humshaugh say Patricia Tabram, 66, mixed pot into her recipes as a \u201cnatural remedy\u201d for back pain and was soon serving her entr\u00e9es to friends with similar ailments.   \u201cMy cannabis chocolate cake covers the pain for five hours or more, which is why my friends use it.

    "2005 - 1620": "New Jersey Gov. Richard Codey yesterday came out swinging at a shock jock who suggested on the air that the state\u2019s first lady was \u201ccrazy\u201d because she once suffered from postpartum depression.   Codey and Craig Carton, co-host of the \u201cJersey Guys\u201d show on WKXW/101.5 FM, first mixed it up Tuesday when they ran into each other in a hallway at the Trenton-area station. Codey was there to do his monthly call-in show.   A day earlier, Carton had mocked Mary Jo Codey\u2019s depression, which caused her to have murderous thoughts after the birth of her first child 20 years ago.   Her husband, who became governor when Jim McGreevey resigned last year, has long been an advocate for the mentally ill.   \u201cWhat Governor Codey ought to do is approve the use of medical marijuana so women can have a joint and relax instead of putting their babies in a microwave,\u201d Carton said, according to The Star-Ledger.   \u201cWomen who claim they suffer from this postpartum depression . . . must be crazy in the first place.\u201d   The next day, Codey pounced on Carton at the radio station.   \u201cI wish I weren\u2019t governor, I\u2019d take you out,\u201d Codey said, according to the newspaper\u2019s account of the exchange.   Yesterday, Codey was still in a mood to fight, albeit in the safer setting of a news conference.   \u201cI defended my wife like any man or husband would,\u201d Codey said.   He also said he told Carton he would take him outside, not out.   On air, Carton demanded his own apology.   \u201cIf I do not get an apology from him, and he owes me one, he will wind up the same way McGreevey did \u2013 out of office, based on the power of this show,\u201d Carton said.

    "2005 - 750": "A Bronx apartment went up in flames yesterday after high-intensity lights used to grow marijuana ignited the crop and surrounding walls, fire officials said.   The makeshift pot farm inside an apartment at 1585 E 172nd St. caught fire around 10:40 a.m., requiring 60 units and 150 firefighters to fight the blaze.   The tenants of the third-floor apartment where the fire broke out had cut a hole into the ceiling to access the apartment above and had constructed several interior walls to hide their stash, officials said.   The fire spread quickly to the fourth and fifth floors and required a third alarm before it was brought under control around 12:30 p.m.   Fire officials turned the pot case over to police at the scene, a FDNY spokesman said.",

    "2005 - 2378": "A transit worker made a grisly discovery in a Brooklyn subway tunnel yesterday \u2013 a plastic bag stuffed with human body parts.   Cops identified the victim as 19-year-old Rashawn Brazell, of Gates Avenue in Brooklyn.   The horrifying find was made at around 3 a.m. as workers were doing a routine inspection of the tracks about 300 feet away from the Nostrand Avenue and Fulton Street station in Bedford-Stuyvesant.   The body parts \u2013 which included two legs severed just below the torso and two arms chopped off at the shoulders \u2013 had been stuffed in a blue plastic bag and dumped alongside the tracks.   The track worker spotted a leg sticking out of the bag, police said. Another plastic bag was found by the worker a few feet away on the Manhattan-bound side of the tracks.   That bag contained power tools and bloody drill bits.   Brazell was identified through his fingerprints, which were taken after a marijuana arrest, cops said.   His family was too distraught to speak last night, but a friend said the gruesome murder was incomprehensible.   \u201cI don\u2019t know how anyone could do something like this,\u201d said Jacqueline Perez, 20, who has known Brazell since they were kindergartners.   She said Brazell was someone who liked to have fun and was so into fashion, he made his own clothes.   \u201cHe was always wearing something that made your head turn,\u201d she said.   A police source said the victim was bisexual, but the case is not being investigated as a bias crime.   Train service along the A line was disrupted for three hours overnight between Jay Street/Borough Hall and Euclid Avenue in Brooklyn.   Service was restored at 6 a.m., in time for the morning rush hour.   Police said the body parts were likely dumped along the track bed, rather than thrown off a moving train. They also believe that the crime was not committed near where the limbs were found.   And it is unclear whether the bag of bloody drill bits is related to the body parts.   The discovery of the remains came as statistics for overall crime in the subway system saw a 2 percent increase last year, compared to 2003.   There were three subway homicides in 2004 \u2013 one less than in the previous year.   The minor increase in subway crime was fueled by a surge in assaults, with 281 reported last year \u2013 24 more than in 2003. <em>Additional reporting by Murray Weiss, Ed Robinson and Ilan Kayatsky</em>"
