    "2007 - 2285": " You won\u2019t find this particular flavor of cannoli on Mulberry Street.   A Nassau County correction officer has been charged with attempting to deliver a box of cannolis \u2013 one of them packed with marijuana \u2013 to an inmate on Christmas Eve.   Nassau County police arrested Rocco Bove, 24, of Westbury, on Wednesday after he allegedly dropped off a box filled with the Italian pastry treats at the Nassau County Correctional Center in East Meadow.   Police said he instructed the officers on duty to deliver the pastries to an acquaintance of his who was being held at the facility.   But a source close to the investigation said one of his colleagues decided to take a bite after Bove had left. He was stunned to taste marijuana.   Police said the suspicious cannoli was taken in for lab tests, which confirmed that it indeed contained marijuana filling. Cops said rolling papers, matches and a flint pad were also in the package.   Bove, hired as a correction officer on April 29, 2005, was charged with promoting prison contraband and unlawful possession of marijuana.   He pleaded not guilty and was released on $10,500 bail posted by his brother before hustling out of court in Hempstead without comment.   Prosecutors asked for a stiff bail, citing Bove\u2019s position as a correction officer. They noted that he allegedly included four separate types of contraband in his package.   His attorney, Benedict Gullo, suggested that Bove may have been the victim of mischief on the part of his colleagues.   Gullo said proper protocols for the delivery of goods to inmates were not followed and that the cannoli may have been tampered with. He added that Bove had no connection to the inmate in question.   Bove, who lives with his mother, had no prior criminal history and has been suspended without pay.   Lt. Michael Golio, of the Nassau County Sheriff\u2019s office, declined to comment on the case, citing an ongoing investigation. Nassau County Police spokesman Tony Repalone said the cannoli\u2019s traditional cream filling was taken out and replaced with an amount of marijuana sufficient for \u201cpersonal use.\u201d Filling was put back in to hide the pot.   No one answered the door at Bove\u2019s home yesterday.<em><a class=\"a10blb\" href=\"mailto:selim.algar@nypost.com\">selim.algar@nypost.com</a></em>",

Police said Mark Serrano, 29, and Charles Gilleo, Jr., 31, had a hand in the grisly killing of Manuel and Tina Morey and their three young sons, and the torching of their Fishkill home.   The two Dutchess County men were charged only with one count of second-degree murder each for the death of Manuel \u201cTony\u201d Morey, 33, prosecutors said.   More charges could be added after a grand jury investigation, the prosecutors added.   \u201cThe horrific facts of this case speak for themselves,\u201d said Dutchess District Attorney William Grady. \u201cIf the facts justify it, [the grand jury] could in fact return a charge of murder in the first degree.\u201d   An uncle of Tina Morey said \u201cthe family is happy about the work [authorities] have been doing.   \u201cI just want justice. So far justice has been done, they\u2019ve been caught,\u201d he said.   Manuel Morey knew the two suspects through a \u201cdrug connection,\u201d said New York State Police Capt. Keith Corlett.

Their car was found burning a few minutes later less than a mile away and not far from where Gilleo lives, authorities said.

William Carey.
