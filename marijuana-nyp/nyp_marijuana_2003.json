    "2003 - 3525": "If the Knicks are still interested in Damon Stoudamire, they can rest assured that the feeling is mutual.  The Blazers point guard, a trading block mainstay the last two years, has long been rumored to be a Scott Layden target as the GM continues his attempts to upgrade his team at the point guard position.  And now that Stoudamire is out of Maurice Cheeks\u2019 rotation in Portland, the diminutive scorer told The Post he would certainly welcome a move to New York.  \u201cIf I could come into a situation like this, that would be great,\u201d Stoudamire said before last night\u2019s Garden tilt against the Knicks. \u201cI would love to play here. New York has always been the Mecca of basketball to me, and if that would happen, I would look forward to that.\u201d  Of course, no team in the NBA has been the subject of more trade rumors than Portland, owners of the league\u2019s highest payroll. What\u2019s more, the Blazers are in an interesting spot now as they possess an embarrassment of riches in the backcourt.  Derek Anderson, Antonio Daniels, Scottie Pippen, Bonzi Wells and Jeff McInnis are ALL splitting time in the rotation. The mix is so crowded that even hotshot rookie Qyntel Woods can\u2019t find any daylight.  Lately, Stoudamire hasn\u2019t found any either. He hasn\u2019t played in five of the last six games. And assuming Portland continues to roll \u2013 Cheeks\u2019 crew has won nine-of-10 \u2013 there\u2019s really no reason to expect that to change.  What\u2019s likely instead is a deal of some sort. The Post\u2019s Peter Vecsey reported yesterday that the team was looking at high-scoring Atlanta guard Jason Terry and that perhaps Wells could be part of that package.  Other deals may be percolating as well. And Stoudamire could very well be involved in one. He has an acrimonious relationship with GM Bob Whitsitt and has even hinted that Whitsitt, not Cheeks, is the one behind his benching.  Just another reason why he\u2019d welcome the opportunity to leave his hometown team.  \u201cAs a guy not playing, I\u2019m always going to root for my teammates, but in the back of my mind, if something was to happen with me, I would be happy with that,\u201d he said with a laugh.  The 5-10 Stoudamire, a former NBA Rookie of the Year, was once one of the game\u2019s brightest young players, but his star has dimmed thanks to marijuana citations off the court and inconsistent shooting on the court. This season he is averaging 6.1 ppg on 33 percent shooting, both career lows by far.  The 29-year-old Stoudamire has averaged 15.2 points and 7.0 assists in his eight years and is a 41 percent career shooter. He is well-respected in NBA circles, but his salary ($12.375 million this season, $26 million over the next two years) might make it difficult for the \u201cfiscally responsible\u201d Knicks to make a run at him.  If they <em>are</em> interested, the Knicks would likely also ask Portland for Pippen, who\u2019s in the final year of his contract.  Meanwhile, the Blazers would presumably want a package centered around Latrell Sprewell, who could team with Ruben Patterson in a dynamic defensive pairing to guard Western Conference swingmen like Kobe Bryant and Michael Finley.  Another Portland guard who might be a good fit in New York is Daniels, who is cheaper ($3.4 million) and younger (27) than Stoudamire.  Daniels, playing fewer than 12 minutes a night, also admits the team\u2019s guard is \u201cdifficult\u201d but said he doesn\u2019t dream of playing anywhere else.  \u201cRight now, I\u2019m extremely happy in Portland with my role here,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cYou can only worry about things you\u2019re capable of controlling.\u201d",
    "2003 - 2113": "If the Knicks are still interested in Damon Stoudamire, they can rest assured that the feeling is mutual.  Long rumored to be a Scott Layden target, the Blazers point guard has fallen out of the rotation in Portland and would more than welcome a move to New York.  \u201cThat would be great,\u201d Stoudamire told the Post before last night\u2019s Garden tilt against the Knicks. \u201cI would love to play here. New York has always been the Mecca of basketball to me, and if that would happen, I would look forward to that.\u201d  Of course, Stoudamire, 5-10, would probably look forward to ANY situation that would remove him from Portland. Not only has he been a DNP in six of the last seven games (he sat again in last night\u2019s 92-89 Knick loss), he also has an acrimonious relationship with Blazers GM Bob Whitsitt.  \u201cIf something was to happen with me, I would be happy with that,\u201d Stoudamire said with a laugh.  During a break in last night\u2019s action, fans behind the Portland bench began begging for Stoudamire to get traded here.  \u201cI\u2019ll stay in your doghouse to get here,\u201d Stoudamire, one not so picky about his living arrangements, replied to the fans.  The 29-year-old owns career averages of 15.2 points and 7.0 assists, but has seen his star dim thanks to marijuana citations and inconsistent shooting. This season he\u2019s averaging 6.1 ppg on 33% shooting, both career lows.  Stoudamire\u2019s salary ($12.375 million this season, $26 million over the next two years) might also make it difficult for the \u201cfiscally responsible\u201d Knicks to make a run at him.  * Don Chaney was asked about the NBA\u2019s decision to suspend Ron Artest for three games after he destroyed a $100,000 camera Friday night.  \u201cI try not to ever second-guess the league in terms of how they come to that assessment,\u201d Chaney said.  The head coach sounded serious, but the response brought a mild chuckle. Chaney complained this week about Clarence Weatherspoon\u2019s suspension and the lack of foul calls for Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston.  * Houston missed a third-quarter free throw, ending his streak of 38 straight makes, three shy of Sprewell\u2019s franchise mark.",
    "2003 - 5080": " ST. REGIS MOHAWK RESERVATION \u2013 Thursday night, about a half-hour after dark, three small boats left the shore of Cornwall Island, Canada, laden with contraband.  Outfitted with powerful engines capable of blasting them at 90 mph across the half-mile width of the St. Lawrence River to the United States, the smugglers took off in separate directions for the facing shore.  The U.S. Border Patrol agents were watching with an infrared night scope. But in a patrol boat with a top speed of just 50 mph, they could select only one boat to chase.  They picked the closest.  When the Border Patrol finally chased the boat ashore, its two passengers fled in a waiting truck leaving behind a cargo of 16 pounds of hydroponic marijuana \u2013 worth $64,000 on the streets of Manhattan.  The other two boats presumably made their deliveries \u2013 and that highlights a problem that haunts all levels of homeland security in the wake of 9/11.  United States authorities have no jurisdiction within Indian reservations on or across our borders. They potentially are the weakest link in the new wall of security thrown up since Sept. 11, 2001.  Among the most troubling of these yawning gaps in our security is the 16,000-acre St. Regis Indian Reservation, a sovereign territory that straddles the borders of two countries, two provinces and one state, New York.  In a region of lakes, rivers and wilderness, crisscrossed by international borders and reservation boundaries, smugglers play a game of cat-and-mouse with law-enforcement officials as they dart through differing areas of jurisdiction. Catchable one minute, untouchable the next.  \u201cIt\u2019s a nightmare,\u201d Border Patrolman Dick Ashlaw said of the area near Cornwall Island on the St. Lawrence River \u2013 recognized as one of the easiest illegal routes into the United States.  \u201cThe most powerful computer couldn\u2019t come up with a situation more advantageous to smugglers and more difficult for law enforcement,\u201d he said.  While Thursday night\u2019s smugglers had drugs, two years ago they would most likely have been carrying illegal aliens who might have paid up to $47,000 to be carried into the United States, officials said.  In 1998, an alien-smuggling ring moving 100 to 150 aliens a month through the reservation was busted.  Government figures show that from Oct. 1, 2001, to Sept. 30, 2002, 1,736 aliens were caught being smuggled into the United States along a 261-mile stretch of border that includes the roughly 8 miles belonging to the reservation.  So it was no surprise that fingers pointed to the reservation two weeks ago when the FBI falsely reported five possible terrorists had infiltrated the United States from Canada.  But those who live and work on the reservation say they are doing their bit for homeland security.  The Border Patrol has added 20 new positions in the last 12 months. The agency also has a new helicopter and a pilot, thermal-imaging cameras, motion sensors and night-vision equipment.  And although cigarette, drug and gun smuggling remains rife, reservation elders say the alien trade has all but disappeared in the area \u2013 a claim backed by the most recent Border Patrol figures that list just one infiltration in the region since October last year, when nine Costa Ricans bound for New York City were nabbed on Dec. 23, and they weren\u2019t on the reservation.  The reason is due in large part to interdiction from the St. Regis tribal community, authorities say.  The St. Regis \u201ctribe is full of war veterans and ironworkers who helped build the World Trade Center,\u201d Ashlaw said.  \u201cThey weren\u2019t going to let these aliens keep coming through their community.\u201d  Andrew Thomas, tribal police chief on the U.S. side of the St. Regis reservation, says he wasn\u2019t surprised when newspapers and law enforcement outside the area looked to the reservation when the fictitious five terrorists were reported.  But he knew better.  Since 9/11, Thomas says he regularly called people on the reservation he knew, but hadn\u2019t been able to prove, were involved in smuggling.  \u201cWe put them on notice,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was going to stop. Enough is enough.\u201d  The community of 8,000 took the police\u2019s lead.  No longer turning a blind eye to the alien smuggling around them, they created a network of informal informants.  When Mike Swamp, head of the local ironworker\u2019s union, was driving to a hockey game last year and saw someone walking down the street carrying a suitcase, he called the police.  \u201cWe helped erect the World Trade Center,\u201d he says. \u201cWe helped with the cleanup. And now they come back and say you were involved somehow. That doesn\u2019t just hurt me, it hurts the whole community.\u201d  Morris Adams, a Mohawk ironworker who helped build the World Trade Center, and whose sons helped with the cleanup, says he knew aliens were being brought through the reservation, and after 9/11, he was going to help stop it.  \u201cEverybody knows everybody, you know if somebody\u2019s not supposed to be here. I call the cops right away, \u2018Who are these people?\u2019 I don\u2019t want them coming through here anymore.\u201d  Additional reporting by Al Guart ",
    "2003 - 2144": "<strong>P</strong>LEASE be sure to put young children and sensitive adults safely to bed before taking this quiz:  Court fans, for whom do you feel sorriest?

As her lawyer tells it, he granted free rooms to guests who left \u201cwet condoms\u201d on the floor.  Or, is the wronged person former Park Lane Hotel manager Charles Bell? Bell says he did a sterling job, restricted his drug use to off-hotel premises, and endured taunts of \u201cfaggot\u201d by Helmsley, who ultimately fired him because he was gay.  \u201cIt was devastating; it changed my entire life,\u201d Bell said in the hallway of Manhattan Supreme Court.

It is possible to feel sorry for Leona Helmsley. This is a rich dame of 82, whose stern mask of a face seems to have transformed over the years into caricature.  The lady has a jail term for tax evasion and the public humiliation of being courted by a gay man who evidently wanted something from the old bird other than her body. And still, she keeps on ticking.  Leona\u2019s lawyer told prospective jurors that Bell isn\u2019t the little innocent. He said Bell lied on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 about his hotel experience, and was so whacked out from smoking marijuana, taking \u201cecstasy\u201d and an animal tranquilizer known as vitamin K while on duty, he could not properly perform his job.

    "2003 - 2853": "A popular Bronx math teacher has been allowed to retire with his full pension after admitting he sexually abused one of his female students \u2013 25 years ago, The Post has learned.   MS 141 instructor Alan Lasher also was accused of kissing another underage girl on the lips around the same time, an internal schools probe has found.   The two students, then minors but now adults, decided to go public with their secret after divulging their \u201cencounters\u201d with Lasher to each other in an online class-reunion chat last year.   Lasher, 55, also was accused of smoking marijuana with four students-RT&gt;including the two girls.   \u201cAlthough Alan Lasher cannot be prosecuted because the statute of limitations has expired, his inexcusable acts of sexual abuse toward [the first student] were criminal and horribly wrong. He has no place in the city\u2019s public-school system,\u201d according to the report issued by Special Schools Investigator Richard Condon.   Lasher, who stepped down last summer, admitted to \u201ccommitting sexual acts\u201d with the first girl, but said he couldn\u2019t recall kissing the other or smoking pot with students, investigators said.   The teacher\u2019s abuse of the first girl extended through the 1977-78 school year.   Lasher initiated sex in the school\u2019s basement book room and in his car, and had intercourse with the minor in his parents\u2019 apartment in The Bronx when they were on vacation, the girl told investigators.   The girl\u2019s mother suspected something was wrong when she read her daughter\u2019s diary, which detailed the sexual encounters. The mom confronted Lasher and her daughter.   Lasher got away with it by lying, probers said.   \u201cLasher denied it and then called to warn [the girl] that her mother read about them in the journal. He instructed [the girl] to tell her mother that it was just a fantasy. The student followed Lasher\u2019s advice,\u201d the investigators wrote.   The mother, while believing the lie, instructed Lasher and her daughter not to have any further contact because of the \u201cunhealthy situation.\u201d   The mother never reported her suspicions to school authorities, and Lasher continued teaching. But 10 years later, in 1987, the former student confessed to her mother that what she wrote in her journal was true.   The mother told investigators she confronted Lasher, who admitted he had sex with her daughter. But authorities were not notified until the Internet class reunion last year. That\u2019s when the former student was told by another woman that Lasher had an inappropriate relationship with her, too.   Then, \u201cduring an interview with investigators, Lasher admitted \u2026 in writing, to committing sexual acts with [the first girl] when she was a student at MS 141,\u201d the report said.

    "2003 - 1591": " JERUSALEM \u2013 Leaders of Israel\u2019s pro-marijuana party, who may win their first parliament seat in next week\u2019s national elections, were unexpectedly invited to the U.S. Embassy yesterday to explain their make-pot-not-war program.  Members of the Green Leaf Party, whose emblem is an Israeli flag with a marijuana leaf, said they were asked by U.S. officials about their legislative agenda \u2013 in particular whether they support legalization of drugs other than pot.  Dan Greenblatt, the second-ranked party candidate on Tuesday\u2019s ballot, was pleased by the invitations because he said the embassy usually invites only those parties already represented in the 120-seat Knesset.  Despite the crowded field of 29 parties, polls indicate Green Leaf is close to winning one seat.  Party members say their strength is unknown because a much larger percentage of Israelis smokes pot than are questioned by pollsters.  \u201cIt\u2019s illogical to turn 1 million law-abiding citizens in Israel into criminals,\u201d the party\u2019s commercials say.  Green Leaf not only advocates legalizing pot, but also planting it in toxic waste dumps to soak up heavy metals.  Israel\u2019s volatile political scene is so unsettled that according to the latest poll, an anti-clerical faction may become the second largest party.  The Shinnui Party, which vows to cut government perks for Orthodox Jews, may outpoll the Labor Party, the party of past prime ministers such as Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres and Ehud Barak, the Yediot Achronoth poll found. Both run well behind Prime Minister Ariel Sharon\u2019s Likud Party.  With Post Wire Services ",
