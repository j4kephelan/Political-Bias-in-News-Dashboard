    "2022 - 4988": "Cannabis\u00a0can impair a person\u2019s ability to drive up to 4 hours after the\u00a0drug\u00a0is used, according to a recent\u00a0<a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2788264?guestAccessKey=c31eeaa1-94d3-4f16-8f22-8ab39c92b3cb&amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=012622\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">study</a>.\u00a0\u201cAlthough performance was improving at 3.5 hours, recovery was not fully seen until 4.5 hours post smoking'\u201d researchers stated in the\u00a0report published in the JAMA Psychiatry.A group of researchers from the Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research at the\u00a0University\u00a0of\u00a0California\u00a0San Diego looked at 191 regular cannabis users and found that smoking cannabis led to significantly declined simulated driving scores, according to the authors of the two-year randomized trial study.\u00a0\u00a0The participants were given either a placebo cigarette or a cannabis cigarette containing either 5.9 % or 13.4 % levels of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive compound in cannabis, the study said.\u00a0\u00a0The researchers found participants in the THC group showed a significant decline in Composite Drive Scores (CDS) related to a 25-minute simulated driving experience. The CDS assessed driving variables that included following a lead car while varying speeds, noting swerving in their lane, and responding to divided attention tasks, according to the study.\u00a0The sharpest comparative difference in driving scores between the placebo and the THC group was noted at 30 minutes and 1 hour and 30 minutes after the time of inhaling the cannabis cigarette, according to the published report.\u00a0The study said borderline differences in driving scores were found between the two groups at 3 hours 30 minutes and no differences were noted at 4 hours 30 minutes.The researchers said in the report that the participants were hesitant to drive immediately after smoking but nearly 69% of the participants reported they were ready to drive at 1 hour 30 minutes post inhalation, setting up a potentially dangerous scenario.\u201cAlthough users in the THC group felt impaired and were hesitant to drive at 30 minutes, by 1 hour-30 minutes they believed the impairment was wearing off and were more willing to drive. This was despite their performance not significantly improving from the 30 minute point,\u201d Senior author Thomas Marcotte, PhD, co-director of CMCR and a professor of psychiatry at UC San Diego School of Medicine, said in the University news release.Marcotte added, \u201cThis may indicate a false sense of safety, and these first few hours may constitute a period of greatest risk since users are self-evaluating whether it is safe to drive.\u201dThe authors of the study also found that simulated driving ability decreased in the THC group, but it was not related to blood THC concentration, THC content of the cigarette, or history of THC use.\u201cThe complete lack of correlation between blood concentrations and driving performance was somewhat surprising,\u201d Co-author Robert Fitzgerald, PhD, professor of clinical pathology at UC San Diego School of Medicine said in a news release. Fitzgerald who is also the director of the Toxicology Laboratory and associate director of Clinical Chemistry Laboratory at UC San Diego Health added \u201cits strong evidence against developing \u2018per se\u2019 driving under the influence statutes.\u201d\u201cPer se\u201d laws, establish that a violation occurred if a legal standard was broken.\u00a0For example, having a 0.08 BAC (blood alcohol content) after a breath test or blood test, by itself,\u00a0 means that you will be likely be found guilty of driving while intoxicated without any other evidence to support that, according to legal experts.\u00a0\u00a0California State Assemblymember Tom Lackey (R-Palmdale) said in the UCSD news release,\u00a0\u201cThis groundbreaking research indicates that cannabis use does impair driving ability, but factors differ from alcohol.\u201d\u00a0Lackey also said, \u201cFor example, these data show that per se laws for THC levels are not supported scientifically. It also underscores the need for further research on this topic. Policymakers still need a better understanding of the effects of different ways of consuming higher concentration products to charter a path forward.\u201dThe California researchers said that the study emphasizes the challenge in understanding the relationship between cannabis consumption and an individual\u2019s ability to drive as well as identifying which individuals are most at risk for impaired driving when using cannabis.\u00a0Co-author of the study Igor Grant, MD, CMCR director and Distinguished Professor of Psychiatry at UC San Diego School of Medicine pointed out in the release the need to appropriately label cannabinoid medicines.\u00a0The study authors suggested future research addressing factors such as personal experience with cannabis,\u00a0ways cannabis is ingested by an individual, and the individual\u2019s biological differences in relation to driving impairment.",

Animal Cookies, a sativa/indica blend, was priced at $55.

They put on a night-time gathering that drew people who love looking at art and getting high.\u201cLegally, you can smoke cannabis anywhere you can smoke tobacco,\u201d said Zakim. \u201cThe smoking was all done outside. They sold $100,000 worth of\u00a0tickets. They knew the Munkey would attract people who\u2019d consume cannabis and that cannabis would enhance the experience.\u201dAccording to\u00a0Nick Harkin, the exhibit\u2019s spokesman,\u00a0\u201cIt is true that $100,000 of tickets were sold. Pre-rolls were included in the gift-bags that Happy Munkey distributed, and we had a designated, confined outdoor space where smoking was permitted but nowhere inside the building.\u201dThen there\u2019s the group of weed-dealing pals from Harlem who stole a page from food-truck chefs: They created Green Truck, a collective of parked vehicles out of which pot gets sold. The seats of the vehicles, repurposed Access-a-Ride buses, have been removed and counters put in.The idea came about last September after a Bronx seller set up shop in his car in the Bronx, said Attache II, a Green Truck co-founder.\u201cWe said, \u2018What happens if we put out a table and sell it off of a table?\u2019 The worst is that we would lose our product and get a ticket.\u201d So the friends began selling on the sidewalk on 125<sup>th</sup>\u00a0Street and Lenox Avenue, and no cops bothered them, according to Attache II.\u201cThere were lines all over the place \u2014 hundreds of people were around us, there to buy weed \u2014 and it got uncomfortable,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we said, \u2018F\u2013k it.

Green Trucks can be found parked in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx, with former street dealers manning the vehicles and pot going out in exchange for \u201cdonations.\u201dOne, selling a house-brand dubbed Uncle Bud,\u00a0has been parked at Bleecker and Lafayette in the West Village since Thanksgiving.

From 2020 to 2021, homicides in the Lone Star metropolis have dropped from 254 to 220, and violent crime has <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/commentary/2021/12/30/year-end-dallas-stats-show-an-impressive-drop-in-violent-crime-how-did-chief-eddie-garcia-do-it/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">nosedived</a> by 12 percent since May last year.\u00a0How did Dallas do it? In early 2021, Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson recruited Eddie Garcia as his new police chief. Garcia, who had spent four years as the police chief of San Jose, Calif., quickly created a plan with University of Texas criminologists, implemented it, and saw crime rates drop almost immediately.\u00a0Officer morale, as a result, has improved, Johnson told The Post.\u201cMorale is up and noticeable,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cThe police are attacking violent crime at its source with a level of vigor and enthusiasm we hadn\u2019t seen for years.\u201dAs soon as he started on the job, Garcia and his team of criminologists focused on where the worst crimes happen. \u2018We broke Dallas down into 104,000 grids. Just 50 of those grids are responsible for 10 percent of the violent crime in the city.\u2019\u201cWe broke Dallas down into 104,000 grids. Just 50 of those grids are responsible for 10 percent of the violent crime in the city. And so only a relatively small number of areas are responsible for a large amount of crime. It\u2019s a small amount of individuals,\u201d Garcia explained.In Dallas, the most troublesome areas were apartments. \u201cWe had murders, robberies, and assaults in apartment complexes,\u201d Garcia said. The police, along with other city services, examined the complexes to see how they could make them safer. For each building, they would say, \u201cIt needs fencing and lighting. We ask, \u2018Who do you hold accountable to get that done?\u2019 And, \u2018Do we need a park? Youth activity? Do the streets need work?\u2019\u201dBut their plan wasn\u2019t just midnight basketball and conflict resolution workshops. \u201cPolice obviously need to rid the criminal element,\u201d stressed Garcia. He said he is seeking to balance carrots and sticks \u2014\u00a0rewards for good behavior with threats of consequences if people break laws. Focused deterrence means police made themselves more visible in violent areas, <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/commentary/2021/12/30/year-end-dallas-stats-show-an-impressive-drop-in-violent-crime-how-did-chief-eddie-garcia-do-it/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">seizing</a> 27 percent more guns and 8 percent more drugs in 2021 than in 2020.But Dallas police do not treat all drugs equally. The department has moved away from targeting low-level marijuana possession, for example.Prominent African-American community leader Derrick Battie, of South Oak Cliff Alumni Barricade Association, applauded Garcia\u2019s approach to \u201cweed out the bad elements from communities and seed in good things like sports gaming, music studios, and boxing gyms and afterschool\u00a0programs.\u201d\u00a0Garcia has also been visiting prisons with community leaders to emphasize his carrot-and-stick approach. \u201cIn a couple of weeks I\u2019m going to correctional facilities with violence interrupters, victim advocates, reentry services, federal partners, pastors, and voices from the community,\u201d he said.He said has a message for prisoners being released: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to cause havoc, you\u2019re going to end up back in here. But if you need job training, education, mental health, substance abuse help, we want to help you succeed.\u201d\u00a0When I asked Garcia what explained the rise in crime in the first half of 2021 and its decline in the second half, he said, \u201cIt is morale. No plan works without officer morale. If morale is not at a certain level, there\u2019s nothing I can do as chief to force policemen and women to make an investigative stop at 2 or 3 in the morning to take someone into custody for narcotics. They\u2019ll only do so if they feel supported by the department and mayor.\u201dEchoing that sentiment is Michael Smith, a criminologist at the University of Texas, San Antonio, who worked with Garcia for three years when he was at San Jose and also helped him create his plan for Dallas.\u201cMorale is absolutely important,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe have a very sound, evidence-based plan. All components of it are based on the best science. But I\u2019m convinced that what makes this plan successful \u2026 is the men and women of the Dallas police department who were out there doing their job assertively, not aggressively\u2026They\u2019re doing it assertively and professionally. They have bought into Garcia\u2019s vision. Cops can be a cynical group but Johnson and Garcia managed to bring them on board.\u201dMany progressives worry that morale-boosting among officers can lead to cops getting off the hook for bad behavior.\u00a0But that hasn\u2019t been the case in Dallas.\u00a0\u201cThe use of force is down in Dallas,\u201d said Smith. \u201cWe\u2019ve managed to reduce violent crime in our targeted hotspots by more than 50 percent and about 15 percent citywide.\u201d\u00a0As in many other cities across the country, activists in Dallas have called for defunding the police in recent years.\u201cThere was a significant percentage of our activist community who wanted us to cut our police budget by 40- to 60 percent,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cI got protested at my house for several weeks by people saying not very nice things to me. It wasn\u2019t fun. I had to remind myself constantly why we were doing it.\u201dDallas leaders were doing it to save lives. \u201cTalk to someone who lives in a neighborhood racked by violent crime, drugs and the violence that comes along with those and ask if they would like to defund the police,\u201d said Johnson, who is black and a Democrat.\u00a0\u201cFolks in those communities never asked for, and never wanted or supported, defunding the police, or fewer police. What they\u2019ve wanted is better trained police and a relationship with police [who] want to deter violent crime in the first place. Calls for defunding the police are coming from people who aren\u2019t in the communities affected by the violence.\u201d\u2018Morale is up and noticeable. The police are attacking violent crime at its source with a level of vigor and enthusiasm we hadn\u2019t seen for years.\u2019Battie, whose Oak Cliff neighborhood is heavily African-American and Latino, agreed. \u201cWe want to see an increase in non-police action. But we never, ever wanted to get rid of the police.\u201dSo can Dallas offer a lesson to Democrats nationwide, who are responding defensively \u2014 once again \u2014 to accusations they are soft on crime?\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in other cities,\u201d Johnson replied. \u201cAnd I have no political advice for the Democrats, per se. But for people in leadership on topics of public safety, you can\u2019t let the politics dictate what you do. You can\u2019t chase political favor on one side or the other with solutions that don\u2019t work \u2014 of \u2018defund the police\u2019 on one side and \u2018police can do no wrong,\u2019 and dismissing concerns of reform advocates. You can end up on either extreme easily. You have to follow the data.\u201d<em>Michael Shellenberger is the author of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/San-Fransicko-Progressives-Ruin-Cities/dp/0063093626/?tag=nypost-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://nypost.com/2022/02/05/how-dallas-smart-police-tactics-bucked-the-national-crime-rise/&amp;asc_source=web\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">San Fransicko: Why Progressives Ruin Cities</a>.\u201d</em>"
