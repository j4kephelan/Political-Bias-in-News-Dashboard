    "2012 - 4573": "<author></author>LOS ANGELES \u2014 Drugs took many things from Whitney Houston \u2014 her pristine voice, clean image and her career \u2014 and coroner\u2019s officials revealed Thursday that cocaine also played a role in the Grammy winner\u2019s death in the bathtub of a luxury hotel nearly six weeks ago.Houston drowned accidentally at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on Feb. 11, and autopsy results revealed heart disease and her recent and chronic cocaine use were contributing factors.The results ended weeks of speculation about what killed the singer-actress at age 48 on the eve of the Grammy Awards and a planned comeback. Instead, Houston now joins the long list of entertainers who have died early with drugs at least partly to blame.Coroner\u2019s officials did not reveal how much cocaine was found in Houston\u2019s system, but said there were signs of recent and chronic use. It was unclear whether she suffered a heart attack before drowning, Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter said.\u201cWe are saddened to learn of the toxicology results, although we are glad to now have closure,\u201d Patricia Houston, the singer\u2019s sister-in-law and manager, said in a statement.Houston\u2019s death the night before the Grammys altered the awards ceremony and brought back immediate memories of the singer in her better days, belting out hits and starring in the feature films such as \u201cThe Bodyguard\u201d and \u201cWaiting to Exhale.\u201d Years later, Houston\u2019s drug use had robbed her of her ability to hit high notes and left her once clean image tarnished.\u201cThe biggest devil is me. I\u2019m either my best friend or my worst enemy,\u201d Houston told ABC\u2019s Diane Sawyer in an infamous 2002 television interview with then-husband Bobby Brown by her side.In 2009, after she had divorced Brown, she told Oprah Winfrey that her cocaine and marijuana use took over her life. Both drugs were found in Houston\u2019s system after she died, though the marijuana and several other prescription drugs played no role in her death, coroner\u2019s officials said.\u201cI had so much money and so much access to what I wanted,\u201d Houston told Winfrey. \u201cI didn\u2019t think about the singing part anymore. I was looking for my young womanhood.\u201dHouston\u2019s planned comeback after that interview didn\u2019t pan out, but she was taking another shot this year with her appearance in a remake of the film \u201cSparkle.\u201dShe stars as the mother of a family of girls who form a singing group and struggle with fame and addiction. She also sang for the film, delivering a soulful rendition of the gospel hymn \u201cHis Eye is on the Sparrow.\u201dIt is unclear what impact, if any, the autopsy results will have on the film, although untimely death has not been an impediment to the posthumous releases of other actors and entertainers. Heath Ledger\u2019s performance in \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d helped propel the film to blockbuster status and earned the actor a posthumous Oscar. He died of an accidental prescription drug overdose in January 2008, months before the film\u2019s release.More recently, Amy Winehouse\u2019s duet \u201cBody and Soul\u201d with Tony Bennett earned them a Grammy Award, months after the singer died unexpectedly in London. An inquest determined she died from an accidental alcohol overdose.A spokesman for Sony Pictures did not return an email message Thursday seeking comment on whether Houston\u2019s autopsy results would alter marketing of \u201cSparkle.\u201dIt will be a couple weeks before the exact amount of cocaine in Houston\u2019s system is released, officials said.The drug has been known to cause damage to the heart and could have cause Houston\u2019s death, said Dr. Michael Fishbein, professor of pathology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. He had no role in the investigation.He said a likely scenario was that Houston\u2019s cocaine use interfered with the normal function of her heart.\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to drown in a bathtub unless you\u2019re incapacitated,\u201d Fishbein said.Houston\u2019s friend and collaborators said after her death that they didn\u2019t believe she was still abusing drugs, and she described as being a complete professional on the \u201cSparkle\u201d set.Houston, a sensation from her first, eponymous album in 1985, was one of the world\u2019s best-selling artists from the mid-1980s to the late 1990s, turning out such hits as \u201cI Wanna Dance With Somebody,\u201d \u201dHow Will I Know,\u201d \u201dThe Greatest Love of All\u201d and \u201cI Will Always Love You.\u201dShe was buried last month in a New Jersey cemetery next to her father after an emotional four-hour funeral service that was attended by friends, family and superstars such as Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Alicia Keys, Mariah Carey, Mary J. Blige, Jennifer Hudson and Roberta Flack",
