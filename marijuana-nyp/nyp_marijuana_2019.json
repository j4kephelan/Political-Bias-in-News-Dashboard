    "2019 - 2835": "The FBI, the US Attorney\u2019s Office and the local authorities are investigating a white police officer who was recorded brutally beating a black motorist in Ohio in 2017, according to a report.They are deciding whether or not to bring charges against the police officer, Michael Amiott, who sparked widespread protests near Cleveland after <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywmrqwLLKJE\">a video emerged</a> of the August 2017 incident, an FBI spokesperson <a href=\"https://www.cleveland.com/crime/2019/01/fbi-federal-prosecutors-investigating-euclid-police-officer-seen-beating-motorist.html\">told cleveland.com</a>.The dashcam video shows Amiott and another officer dragging Richard Hubbard III before punching him more than a dozen times.Both federal and local prosecutors are seriously looking into the investigation, the report said, which started shortly after the traffic stop took place. It\u2019s uncommon for federal prosecutors in northern Ohio to file charges in police brutality cases.Amiott was rehired by the Euclid Police Department in October just over a year after the suburban city\u2019s mayor announced that he would be fired, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/23/us/fired-euclid-ohio-officer-reinstated/index.html\">CNN reported</a>. An arbitrator had ruled that Euclid Mayor Kirsten Holzheimer Gail did not have cause to fire Amiott.Even before the August 2017 incident, Amiott had received multiple complaints about his behavior in three years in Euclid. The police department handed him four letters of reprimand and he received one formal citizen complaint.Amiott was hired in Euclid shortly after he resigned from his position in Mentor, Ohio, another suburb of Cleveland. He was allowed to resign voluntarily from his job there rather than be fired for lying to other officers about a police stop. In Euclid, he has been accused of pistol-whipping a driver with a handgun and being involved in two accidents with cop cars, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2017/08/29/cop-who-violently-beat-man-in-traffic-stop-had-past-complaints/\">among other complaints</a>.He has since been sued by Hubbard and Yolimar Tirado, who was a passenger in the car.\u201cI am glad this matter is being seriously considered because police accountability is very important,\u201d Christopher McNeal, a lawyer who represents them, told cleveland.com. \u201cNot just for my client but the entire nation.\u201dHubbard was initially pulled over for driving without using signals and attempted to walk away, causing a struggle between the two men, according to the police report.Police also claimed to find marijuana in the car, <a href=\"https://www.news-herald.com/news/ohio/euclid-police-officers-sued-by-man-seen-on-video-getting/article_84b118a0-fadb-5263-961d-da6517f98aea.html\">according to the News-Herald</a>, which was later disputed in Hubbard\u2019s lawsuit.",

    "2019 - 7505": "Police describe him as a monster \u2014 a young Wisconsin man so fixated on a hazel-eyed, 13-year-old girl, that he <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/10/15/deputies-searching-for-missing-girl-after-parents-found-dead-in-their-home/\">allegedly shot her parents dead</a> in their home and stole her away, keeping her captive in a wooded cabin for 88 days until her escape.But by all accounts, Jake Thomas Patterson, the accused abductor-murderer in the <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/01/11/jake-thomas-patterson-charged-in-jayme-closs-kidnapping/\">Jayme Closs case</a>, was an average, even boring, young man.The bespectacled 21-year old had no criminal record and shunned social media. He was unknown at the nearest bar and convenience store, and his closest neighbors didn\u2019t know he was around.Even those who do know Patterson recalled him as too unremarkable for the evil of which he is accused.\u201cNever in a million years would I have thought Jake would ever do something like that,\u201d Elissa Lisenby, who attended Northwood High School with Patterson, told The Post on Saturday.\u201cThis isn\u2019t the Jake we all grew up knowing,\u201d she said of her quiet, anxious classmate.\u201cNobody really knew him like we thought,\u201d former classmate Clinton Rolnik told The Post.Jayme spent her second night of freedom with her family Friday, according to her aunt, Jennifer Smith.\u201cJayme had a pretty good night sleep,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bjarlsmith?__tn__=%2Cd*F*F-R&amp;eid=ARBeWA1glfEqIU3fVRzgwqRNhR1uZahfzuHRQACOwnsc3VCceHJxKx139ccFxI_6qeeZdElWVm2XXUWy&amp;tn-str=*F\">Smith wrote on Facebook Saturday</a>. \u201cIt was great to know she was next to me all night.

He was however, on the school\u2019s quiz bowl team.\u201cI don\u2019t really remember a ton about him,\u201d said former middle school science teacher Kristin Kasinskas\u201cI don\u2019t recall anything that would have explained this.\u201dBy coincidence, it was at Kasinskas\u2019s home that Jayme would take refuge after fleeing from Patterson\u2019s cabin on Thursday, police said.\u201cWhen [Jayme] said the name, I said, \u2018I know him \u2014 I\u2019ve had that student,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/suspected-killer-kidnapper-s-life-remains-a-mystery/504229742/\">she told the Star Tribune</a>.\u201cHe was a nice kid,\u201d she said. \u201cQuiet kid. Very smart. He didn\u2019t speak out in class.\u201dHe never had a girlfriend that any pal could remember.\u201cHe was always a little awkward,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/jake-patterson-identified-as-suspect-in-jayme-closs-kidnapping?ref=scroll\">Rolnik told the Daily Beast</a>.\u201cI guess just really shy.\u201dThey\u2019d swim together in the nearby river, ride dirt bikes, play video games together, but \u201cnothing crazy,\u201d Rolnik said.Patterson had made some unsuccessful passes at finding a career \u2014 trying the Marines, but dropping out during boot camp, and working three years ago at the same Jennie-O turkey plant as James and Denise Closs, Jayme\u2019s parents, who he\u2019s charged with murdering.James was 56; Denise was 46.A company spokesman said that Patterson left the turkey plant after a single day of work, explaining he was moving. Investigators told reporters they don\u2019t believe Patterson had any contact there, or elsewhere, with the Closs family.Aside from these forays into the working world, Patterson was just basically \u201csitting at home doing nothing, as usual,\u201d since graduating, Rolnik said.If anything, the likely Patterson to get into trouble was his big brother, who pleaded no contest in 2013 after being charged with sexually assaulting a 15-y-o girl when he was 18, according to multiple reports.The brother also has a felony marijuana conviction for which he served 30 months probation.But it appears the brother did not live with Jake in the remote, wooded cabin in Gordon, Wis., 80 miles north of Barron, where Jayme was abducted. Investigators say they believe Patterson acted alone.Patterson\u2019s mother and brother did use social media, according to since deleted posts <a href=\"https://heavy.com/news/2019/01/jake-patterson/\">cited by Heavy.com</a>.The mother\u2019s featured religious and inspirational posts. The brother\u2019s indicated he had moved to Colorado, where he was working at a Subway. Both have removed their postings.Patterson seems to have picked Jayme out of thin air, police said after his arrest.\u201cNothing in this case shows the suspect knew anyone at the Closs home or at any time had any contact with anyone in the Closs family,\u201d Barron County Sheriff Chris Fitzgerald told reporters.But this was no spur-of-the-moment attack.Once he set his sights on Jayme, Patterson planned her kidnapping down to the most minute detail, even shaving his head so that he wouldn\u2019t leave DNA-testable hair at the Closs home, authorities contend.There, sometime after midnight on October 15, he arrived, armed. Investigators believe he used a shotgun to blast his way through the front door.A 911 dispatcher received a call from Denise\u2019s cell phone just before 1 a.m., but could only hear the sound of people yelling before the line went dead.Arriving cops found James and Denise Closs dead inside, and Jayme vanished.The middle schooler wound in a secluded cabin in the woods of Douglas County that Patterson\u2019s parents had purchased before their 2007 divorce.Nearly three months after her abduction, on Thursday at 4:30 p.m., while Patterson was out of the cabin, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/01/10/jayme-closs-missing-wisconsin-girl-whose-parents-were-shot-dead-found-safe/\">Jayme managed to flee</a>. She calmly ran up to neighbor Jeanne Nutter, who was out walking her dog.Jayme was skinny, disheveled and wearing pants and shoes that didn\u2019t fit \u2014 but Nutter knew immediately who she was.\u201cThe first thing she told me was, \u2018I\u2019m lost and I don\u2019t know where I am and I need help,\u2019\u201d <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/man-jailed-accused-of-killing-jayme-closs-parents-abducting-her/504214602/\">Nutter told the Star Tribune</a>.In the end, it was Jayme, through her description, who\u2019d lead police to capture her captor, investigators said.Patterson was arrested just eleven minutes after Jayme approached the dog-walking neighbor. Police say he was driving near the cabin \u2014 looking for Jayme.The cabin had been in the name of Patterson\u2019s father, Patrick. Then, days after Jayme\u2019s abduction, ownership passed to a credit union, according to the Associated Press, which said the home was appraised at $79,300.Investigators said they found more than one gun inside, including a shotgun consistent with the type of gun used to kill James and Denise Closs.<em>Additional reporting by Dean Balsamini and Anthony Izaguirre, w</em><em>ith Post Wires</em>",
    "2019 - 1531": "His Uber-stupid plan went up in smoke.A Pennsylvania man allegedly left two pounds of marijuana in the back seat of an Uber \u2014 and was arrested after he tried to get the ganja back from undercover state troopers, according to a report.When Malik Mollett, 21, hailed an Uber near Pittsburgh in late December, he left behind his bag containing the weed, NBC-affiliate WPXI reported.Mollet had contacted Uber, which reached out to the driver about the missing bag.The unidentified driver called police earlier this month after finding the load of marijuana sealed in plastic inside the bag.A trooper with the Pennsylvania State Police then posed as the Uber driver on Jan. 9 and called Mollett to set up a meeting to return the bag to him, the news outlet reported.The trooper texted Mollett a photo of the bag and Mollet confirmed it was his.The two made arrangements to meet up at a McDonald\u2019s in the borough of Irwin.When Mollett arrived at the McDonald\u2019s, the undercover trooper went inside and gave an apparently happy Mollet the carrier, according to the report.\u201cI think he even made a reference to \u2018how much of this did you guys smoke?\u2019 And the undercover officer that we had dropping it off said they did not consume any of his marijuana,\u201d Trooper Steve Limani said, according to ABC 7.Then another trooper entered the fast-food joint and arrested Mollet, WPXI reported, citing police.Mollett is being held on $150,000 bail.Authorities say the Mollett\u2019s marijuana was high grade with a street value of several thousand dollars."
