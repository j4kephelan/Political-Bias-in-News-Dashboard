    "2006 - 1393": "A New Jersey go-go lounge made famous as the location for \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d Bada Bing club became linked to a real-life mob drama yesterday, when prosecutors announced the strip joint\u2019s manager was swept up in one of the biggest illegal gambling dragnets in state history.  More than 50 members of the alleged scheme were charged as part of a massive bookmaking operation controlled by reputed Genovese crime family associate Robert \u201cElvis\u201d D\u2019Alessio, Bergen County Prosecutor John Molinelli said.  The two-month probe led to the seizure of six guns, piles of cocaine and marijuana, half a dozen cars and $3 million in New Jersey, New York and Florida.  \u201cAs an example of the size of this illegal enterprise, over $1 million per week in illegal wagers were being placed, and an average of $500,000 per week was being paid out and/or collected by D\u2019Alessio and his co-conspirators,\u201d Molinelli said.  D\u2019Alessio, 52, of Montville was charged with first-degree money-laundering and promoting gambling.  Also busted was Victor Cannestro, 36, who prosecutors said is the manager of the Satin Dolls club in Lodi.  Cannestro, who reportedly goes by the nickname \u201cVic the Suit,\u201d could not be reached for comment.  But when asked last year by the Philadelphia Inquirer if any real-life mobsters hung out at Satin Dolls, he said: \u201cOh, maybe a couple, every now and then. But we wouldn\u2019t know who they were.\u201d",

Wyoming cops say Marvin Hackworth of Gillette staged his own disappearance in the Bighorn Mountains after blowing the whopping sum, telling his wife only that he had to \u201cclear his head.\u201d   Search teams spent two days looking for him, but called things off when Hackworth\u2019s daughter got a message from him saying he was OK. He\u2019s now seeking counseling for a gambling problem.   *  A North Dakota State University coed tried to buy marijuana \u2013 at a police station!   Cops say the 20-year-old student called the West Fargo station house and said she wanted to buy grass. When told it was illegal to sell and possess pot, she showed up in person and handed a dispatcher $3, saying she wanted to purchase weed.   \u201c[This is] something that you couldn\u2019t even make up,\u201d said Officer Ken Zeeb, who busted her.   *   High-school sweethearts Willard Mason and Ilah Ost of Blissfield, Mich., became engaged in 1941, but when Mason moved away to work in a war plant, he met another woman and broke things off.

    "2006 - 2005": "This is a love story with a moral: Don\u2019t dally with your friend\u2019s mommy or you might find a Valentine Day\u2019s card carved on your face.   The characters: Elias Nazario, 18; his mom, Nelly; his pal Robert Quinones, 20; and her former boyfriend, a man known only as Freddy.   The place: 852 McDonald Ave. in Borough Park, where the aforementioned reside.   The back story: Robert is having a dalliance with Nelly under the unsuspecting eyes of Elias and the man known only as Freddy.   The action: Elias and Freddy find out about the affair on Valentine\u2019s day, and Elias slashes Robert\u2019s face, authorities say.   The result: Robert gets stitches. Elias gets Rikers.   The mystery: Elias discovers the dalliance through a mystery letter. To be strictly accurate, Freddy discovers the mystery letter, but the letter is in English. Freddy doesn\u2019t understand English, so he asks Elias to translate.   Elias does so, and both men are very upset.   On Valentine\u2019s Day morning, Freddy goes to work. At 7:55 a.m., Robert wakes up to find several deep cuts on his face and Elias standing over him with a sharp metal object, authorities say.   Elias flees and his mother calls 911. Cops arrive. Robert is taken to Lutheran Hospital, where he gets stitches for the cuts.   Elias did it, he tells the cops.   The youth is picked up at his aunt\u2019s home on Ocean Avenue and taken to the 66th Precinct stationhouse, where he is formally arrested at 2 a.m. Wednesday.   Later in the day, he is arraigned in Brooklyn Criminal Court on charges of assault, menacing, harassment and weapons possession.   Unable to make bail of $2,500, he is lodged in Rikers.   Nelly stonewalls.   \u201cNothing happened here. I have no comment. It\u2019s all lies,\u201d she said yesterday.   Authorities say Elias has two priors:   Last September, he was charged with menacing, harassment and weapons possession in a case still pending   Last March, he was charged with possession of marijuana and possession of weapons. He was given a conditional discharge. ",
    "2006 - 2795": "Cops yesterday dismantled a massive interstate gun-running ring \u2013 aided by eagle-eyed detectives who spotted one suspect stashing his arsenal of weapons in a Porta-Potty.   Undercover detectives in \u201cOperation Tripod\u201d posed as gun buyers and were able to purchase a total of 116 guns over the course of a year, Commissioner Ray Kelly announced yesterday.   He said the black-market buys cost cops $118,000, twice the retail value of the assorted firearms.   The sting netted five men and one woman: two from New York and four from Ohio. A seventh man is still on the run.   Daniel Awuku, 34, of Brooklyn and Yusef Logan, 31, of Queens were collared. The out-of-towners under arrest are alleged ringleader Douglas Wellington, 25, Amire Smith, 23, Achsah Washington, 21, and Matthew Brown, 19.   Cops are looking for a third New Yorker: Marvin Mrythil, 26, of Queens.   A search of Mrythil\u2019s house turned up an additional 9mm handgun and 200 small bags of marijuana, Kelly said.   The guns would be illegally bought from the Ohioans and then resold in the city, authorities said.   Kelly said 72 percent of guns used in all crimes in New York City originate from out of state but added, \u201cIt\u2019s rare to apprehend the out-of-town supplier here.\u201d   Wellington and his associates made the 500-mile trip periodically to sell guns in Brooklyn and Queens, according to Kelly.   Most of the guns illegally sold to undercover cops came from stores in Ohio and Maine. Kelly said that yesterday morning, undercover detectives bought 17 handguns, and all of them were new and still in their boxes. The cache included 10 .9mms, four .40-calibers, two .45-calibers and a .380-caliber pistol.   The group was busted in Queens on Farmers Boulevard and North Conduit Boulevard at about 5 a.m., the NYPD said.   If not for savvy detectives staking out the scene before the sale, the guns may not have even been found.   Undercover cops noticed Brown arrive near the scene early and place two large boxes \u2013 with the 17 guns inside \u2013 in a Porta-Potty at a construction site before going to meet for the exchange. The guns were later recovered.   \u201cA less-experienced team of detectives might have missed that ploy,\u201d Kelly said.   The involved cops were from the NYPD\u2019s Firearms Investigation Unit, which lost two members in 2003.   Detectives James Nemorin and Rodney Andrews were killed March 10, 2003, in a botched buy-and-bust.   In a separate investigation, the NYPD\u2019s Gangs Division seized 23 guns from members of the Crips gang on Pennsylvania Avenue in Brooklyn last week, Kelly announced.   Not including today\u2019s guns, he said 430 illegal guns have been taken off the streets of New York since the beginning of the year.   \u2014  Handguns seized yesterday:  10: 9mm   4: .40 caliber  2: .45 caliber   1: .380 caliber",
    "2006 - 943": "A Queens man was nabbed with more than $1 million worth of marijuana last night after cops raided his Bayside apartment and a warehouse where hundreds of illegal plants were growing, authorities said.   Cops served search warrants at the 231st Street apartment and a storage room on 71st Place and seized 250 pounds of marijuana, hydroponic growing equipment, a shotgun and $12,000 cash, police said.   \u201cThis was a pretty sophisticated growing operation,\u201d said Lt. Daniel Heffernan.   \u201cHydroponic [water-grown] stuff is more potent and has a street value of about $350 per ounce.\u201d   The cops said the plants ranged from 6-inches to 6-feet tall.   A two-month investigation into marijuana sales throughout Bayside led cops to alleged farmer Stephen Dimuro, 32, who was charged with criminal possession of marijuana, criminal possession of a controlled substance, and criminal possession of a weapon.   His 32-year-old wife was being questioned.",
    "2006 - 2732": "Cheap cigars meant big bucks for a $40 million stogie-smuggling ring that authorities smoked out yesterday in a series of arrests in New York and Pennsylvania.   The scam involved several licensed tobacco wholesalers in Brooklyn purchasing cigars from a warehouse in Allentown, Pa. \u2013 where there is no cigar tax \u2013 and trucking them to Brooklyn, law-enforcement sources told The Post.   Those wholesalers then sold the stogies to nearly 2,000 Brooklyn retailers without paying the required 37 percent New York state cigar tax, sources said.   Evading that tax scored the crooked wholesalers a smokin\u2019 $16 million in extra annual profit.   The cigars were cheap brands such as \u201cPhillies Blunts,\u201d \u201cBlack &amp; Mild\u201d and \u201cBackwoods,\u201d sources said.   \u201cIt\u2019s a ton of money,\u201d said a source about the \u201cCigar Connection\u201d ring, which is believed to have trafficked nearly 16 million stogies for $40 million in New York each year. \u201cEvery man, woman and child in Allentown, Pa., could not smoke that amount of cigars.\u201d   In one transaction witnessed by investigators, two smugglers swapped $200,000 in cash while sitting in a car parked on a Bay Ridge street.   The smoke screen was uncovered and infiltrated last year by undercover agents from the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance.   Those agents made purchases and sales totaling up to $500,000 per week as part of a six-month sting operated out of a Park Slope warehouse rigged with audio and video surveillance. The sting kicked off with a $120,000 undercover buy of cigars in Allentown, which were quickly sold off to New York retailers.   Yesterday morning, New York State Police, together with investigators from the Brooklyn DA\u2019s Office, the FBI and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms began making the first of 15 planned arrests of people connected to six Brooklyn wholesalers, a wholesale operation in New Rochelle and the Allentown warehouse.   Ten people were in custody by last night, and more than $40,000 in cash and $150,000 in cigars had been seized.   None of the suspects lives a flashy lifestyle, raising concerns about whether the big profits were being sent overseas.  $mokin\u2019 operation   How the cigar-smuggling connection worked:   * New York wholesalers bought cigars at a warehouse in Allentown, Pa., where there is no state cigar tax.   * Wholesalers trucked the cigars to New York, mainly to their own Brooklyn warehouses.   * Wholesalers didn\u2019t pay the 37 percent New York state cigar tax, as required.   * Unpaid tax money was pure profit.   * Wholesalers sold cigars to stores, bodegas and delis.   * Stores sold the cigars to customers, some of whom removed tobacco from the wrappers, refilled them with marijuana and smoked them.

    "2006 - 2210": "AFTER some winters of discontent, defense attorney Bruce Cutler stepped on stage yesterday and sounded like a Shakespearean Richard Burton from Brooklyn.   Prosecutor Mitra Hormozi started the government\u2019s case and Cutler praised it as one of the best openings he ever heard. If the jury voted after it, the two ex-cops would have gone away forever.   Then Cutler strapped on his gun belt and blazed away, saying things changed when he left government office as a prosecutor. \u201cIt was then that a spiritual and moral cancer descended,\u201d Cutler said with a flourish.   It took a little time before it became evident that Cutler was talking about the time when wiseguys were wiseguys \u2013 the Frank Costellos, the Meyer Lanskys, the Vito Genoveses, the old crew who, despite their bad actions, clung to the code of never spilling the beans on a cohort or striking a deal with the government.   The star witnesses in this case against former cops Lou Eppolito and Stephen Caracappa are \u201cthe lowest form of life,\u201d Cutler told a transfixed jury. \u201cThey walk around like tough guys until you take away their gun . . . the jail door slams shut. Then they wet their pants and call for Mommy [the feds].\u201d   Cutler reeled off the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the government\u2019s star witnesses: \u201cat least 10 murders, and maybe 20, five arsons, six tons of marijuana at least, kidnapping, extortion, union fixing.   \u201cLousy lout wannabes . . . they get up when they want to get up, go to bed when they want to and eat all day . . . the swill, bottom of the barrel, the sewer.\u201d   In comparison, he said his client Eppolito freely admits that his father and some relatives were in the mob. \u201cHe had the courage to say no to that life.\u201d   Stephen Caracappa\u2019s lawyer Eddie Hayes said: \u201cPretty much the same old story. Italian names and one family was involved. Look, my family goes way back and they were drunks. I\u2019m not a drunk.\u201d   If these cops are guilty, then they have indelibly put a stain on cops who are among the finest men and women in this city. If they are innocent, it goes back to the old story of rent-a-rat and give him a get-out-of-jail card and prosecutors can put another notch on their gun for being a winner. And justice is the loser.",
    "2006 - 2141": "A gun-wielding teenager has been terrorizing straphangers on the No. 4 and 6 subway lines, police said yesterday.   Brian Ballard, 18, is allegedly responsible for five robberies over the past two months at three Bronx subway stations.   Ballard was identified by the five victims in a photo line-up, sources said.   He allegedly hit stations within a two-mile area stretching from 138th Street to 149th Street in the Melrose section.   Ballard, who has prior arrests for criminal trespassing, possession of marijuana and robbery, punched and mugged the riders at gunpoint inside the stations, police said.   He first struck in a stairwell at the Cypress Ave- nue/East 138th Street station on Jan. 18 at 6 a.m., hitting a 41-year-old man with a gun before taking the victim\u2019s wallet, police said.   On Feb. 18, Ballard allegedly ran past a 22-year-old woman at around 11 p.m. and snatched her cellphone at the same station.   Three days later, Ballard pointed a handgun in the face of a 17-year-old youth who was waiting for a train at around 2 p.m. at the Brook Avenue station, police said.   Ballard demanded that the victim hand over his money, then fled on a southbound No. 4 train, authorities said.   Cops said Ballard also slapped a 16-year-old girl in the face at around 7 p.m. on Feb. 22 as she waited for a train at the Third Avenue Street station before flashing a gun and taking her wallet and iPod.   Ballard last struck on Feb. 23, at around 11 p.m., in a stairwell at the Cypress Avenue station.   In that robbery, Ballard grabbed a 31-year-old man by the neck and stole his wallet, police said.   Ballard is about 5-foot-9 and weighs 150 pounds.   Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at (800) 577-TIPS. All calls will be confidential.   Despite Ballard\u2019s one-man crime wave, the subways have become safer over the past year, statistics show.   The number of major felonies was down 33 percent in January, compared to the same month in 2005, according to NYPD crime statistics.   Cops said there were 99 robberies this past January, compared to 119 during the same month last year \u2013 a 17 percent decrease. "
