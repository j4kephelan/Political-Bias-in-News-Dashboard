    "2016 - 5591": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 It was a daring and elaborate escape: cutting through metal, crawling through plumbing tunnels, climbing a roof, rappelling four stories to freedom using ropes made from bedsheets.But this wasn\u2019t a Hollywood movie: It was <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2016/01/24/manhunt-on-for-3-inmates-who-escaped-jail-by-rappelling-from-roof/\">a real-life breakout that left authorities struggling to find three escapees</a> \u2014 one a suspected killer \u2014 and put together the pieces of how they managed to escape a Southern California maximum-security jail.The priority was finding the men \u2014 who are possibly armed and considered dangerous \u2014 but a probe also is under way to see whether the men had any help from inside or outside the Orange County Men\u2019s Central Jail, authorities said Sunday.Jonathan Tieu, 20, Bac Duong, 43, and Hossein Nayeri, 37, were all awaiting trial for violent crimes in unconnected cases. They vanished from a dormitory they shared with around 65 other men on Friday shortly after the 5 a.m. inmate head count, county sheriff\u2019s officials said.Somehow, the men obtained tools that allowed them to cut through the quarter-inch-thick grill on a dormitory wall, then got into plumbing tunnels. Cutting their way through additional half-inch-thick steel bars, the trio made their way to an unguarded area of the roof of the four-story building, where they apparently moved aside some razor wire and rappelled to the ground using elaborately braided ropes made from linens, authorities said.The escape wasn\u2019t noticed for 16 hours, until a nighttime head count that was delayed about an hour because of a fight involving some other inmates that may \u2014 or may not \u2014 have been part of the escape plan.Clearly, the plan had been long in the making and carefully thought out, sheriff\u2019s Lt. Jeff Hallock said.\u201cWe\u2019re talking about breaching, in some places, significant amounts of steel, rebar and metal,\u201d Hallock said.As federal and local authorities staged an around-the-clock manhunt, there remained a lot of questions about the escape itself. How did the men get the cutting tools? When did they make the rope and where did they stash it? How did they know the jail layout so well? Did they have outside help, maybe a car waiting after they ran off on foot in their orange jail jumpsuits?And perhaps most important: Did other inmates or jail employees help them?\u201cWe\u2019re going to take a look at everybody who may have been assigned there,\u201d Hallock said. \u201cWhat I can assure you is that the compromises in security have been shored up.\u201dHe didn\u2019t provide details.\u201cEscapes do occur from time to time,\u201d Sheriff Sandra Hutchens said. \u201cWe try and limit that. We learn from the mistakes. I can tell you that this is a very sophisticated-looking operation. People in jail have a lot of time to sit around and think about ways to defeat our systems.\u201dThere had been two previous escapes from the jail but they were decades ago. In fact, nobody had managed it in more than 20 years.But the aging jail, built in 1968 and housing some 900 men, does have some vulnerabilities. Its design allows inmates to move through different areas more easily than more modern jails.And inmates do move, which makes it difficult to get daytime head counts.\u201cWe have people going to court, we have people going for medical treatment, and you can\u2019t leave them locked down 24 hours a day. There are requirements that they get out and exercise from time to time,\u201d Hutchens said.The inmates include 20-year-old Jonathan Tieu, who had been held on a $1 million bond since October 2013 on charges of murder, attempted murder and shooting at an inhabited dwelling. His case is believed to be gang-related.On Sunday, his mother and sister said they hadn\u2019t heard from him and tearfully pleaded for him to surrender.\u201cI miss you \u2026 I want my son back,\u201d his mother, <a href=\"http://abc7.com/news/family-of-youngest-oc-jail-escapee-cries-out-for-inmate-to-turn-himself-in/1172540/\">Lu Ann Nguyen of Santa Ana, told KABC-TV</a>.\u201cI for sure know he wasn\u2019t the one who orchestrated this. I feel he was manipulated or tricked into doing this,\u201d said his sister, Tiffany Tieu.\u201cJust turn yourself in. Don\u2019t let (it) drag on,\u201d she said.Hossein Nayeri, 37, had been held without bond since September 2014 on charges of kidnapping, torture, aggravated mayhem and burglary. Nayeri and three other men are accused of kidnapping a California marijuana dispensary owner in 2012. They drove the dispensary owner to a desert spot where they believed he had hidden money and then cut off his penis, authorities said.After the crime, Nayeri fled the US to his native Iran, where he remained for several months. He was arrested in Prague in November 2014 while changing flights from Iran to Spain to visit family.The third escaped inmate, 43-year-old Bac Duong, was being held without bond since last month on charges including attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon and others.While the Mexican border is only a couple of hours south of the prison, authorities said they had no evidence that the men had left the country. Their alleged victims, as well as prosecutors and detectives involved in their cases, have been warned and investigators also are reaching out to their family and acquaintances.Federal authorities are offering $50,000 in rewards for information leading to their recapture.\u201cThere\u2019s people out there that know who these people are, who may have seen them. We\u2019re asking for phone calls, whether it\u2019s any piece of information you may have,\u201d Hallock said.\u201cWe\u2019re exhausting every lead that we currently have,\u201d he said.",
    "2016 - 5178": "A prosecutor pursuing a case against one of the three men <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2016/01/24/manhunt-on-for-3-inmates-who-escaped-jail-by-rappelling-from-roof/\">who broke out of a Southern California prison Friday</a> reacted: \u201cOh, my God, they let Hannibal Lecter out.\u201dHossein Nayeri, a former Marine who had escaped to his native Iran in 2012, faces charges of kidnapping, torture, aggravated mayhem and burglary. Deputy District Attorney Heather Brown <a href=\"http://www.ocregister.com/articles/nayeri-701407-brown-roommate.html\">told the Orange County Register </a>the man is \u201cdiabolical \u2026 sophisticated, incredibly violent and cunning.\u201dBrown says Nayeri helped kidnap a marijuana dealer in 2012, burned him with a blowtorch and forced another suspect to cut off the dealer\u2019s penis because Nayeri thought the man had buried money in the desert. Soon afterward, investigators say he left for Iran, but they caught him while he was on his way to Spain to visit family.\u201cIt\u2019s mind-boggling that he was housed in a dorm with such low-level security,\u201d the prosecutor said, comparing him to the serial killer made famous in the novel and movie \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs.\u201dApparently referencing Brown\u2019s comments, Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas responded, \u201cRecently, statements were made by an OCDA prosecutor that were inappropriate, uninformed, and rash. Those statements were not authorized by me or anyone from the OCDA. Those statements do not reflect the position of the OCDA.\u201dThe three fugitives reportedly had a head start of up to 16 hours before officials realized they were missing.<a name=\"84a24bee3431f19d07b01396cd9515ac-56757169-67247997\"></a> <script src=\"https://video.foxnews.com/v/embed.js?id=4721123744001&amp;w=466&amp;h=263\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script><noscript>Watch the latest video at <a href=\"https://video.foxnews.com\">video.foxnews.com</a></noscript>\nNayeri, Jonathan Tieu and Bac Duong were last seen and accounted for during the regularly scheduled 5 a.m. prisoner count at the Men\u2019s Central Jail in Santa Ana, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-escape-from-orange-county-jail-20160125-htmlstory.html\">according to the Los Angeles Times</a>. The paper reported that a second check, when the men\u2019s escape was discovered, was delayed until 9 p.m. by a brawl that some investigators suspect may have been used to cover up the escape.Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Department spokesman Jeff Hallock said Monday that authorities believe the men escaped soon after the 5 a.m. check.The three men <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2016/01/25/how-three-vicious-criminals-pulled-off-a-hollywood-style-jailbreak/\">sawed through a quarter-inch-thick grill on a dormitory wall and got into plumbing tunnels</a> before sawing through half-inch-thick steel bars as they made their way behind walls to an unguarded area of a roof atop a five-story building. There, they moved aside razor wire and rappelled to the ground using bed linens.The escape has drawn comparisons to last summer\u2019s breakout by two inmates at the Clinton Correctional Facility in upstate New York. A major difference is that while the search for Richard Matt and David Sweat focused on nearby woods, Nayeri, Tieu and Duong escaped in the middle of densely populated Orange County.On Monday, investigators appealed to Orange County\u2019s huge Vietnamese population, among the largest in the US, in Garden Grove and Westminster just a few miles from the Santa Ana jail. Sheriff\u2019s Lt. Dave Sawyer, who is leading the investigation, said Tieu and Duong \u201cmay be embedded\u201d there.\u201cWe sincerely need input from the community to help us,\u201d Sawyer said. Federal authorities are offering up to $50,000 in rewards for information leading to their recapture.Hallock said there is no evidence so far that the trio had help from the inside, but authorities know it\u2019s a possibility.It\u2019s likely someone slipped them blueprints or told them how the bowels of the jail were laid out, he said.It was the first escape in nearly three decades from the California facility built in 1968. It holds 900 men and is located in Santa Ana, about 30 miles southeast of Los Angeles.Hallock said the facility\u2019s general policy is to do walk-throughs every hour to check on inmates. More involved searches are done randomly, he said, but declined to be more specific.It\u2019s also unclear why the inmates \u2014 who were charged with violent felonies \u2014 were housed in a common dorm with more than 60 other inmates. Assignment to a large, busy room likely made it easier for them to avoid detection, Martin Horn, a professor of corrections at John Jay College of Criminal Justice at City University of New York, told the Associated Press.Tieu, 20, had been held on a $1 million bond since October 2013 on charges of murder, attempted murder and shooting at an inhabited dwelling in an alleged gang dispute.Duong, 43, had been held without bond since last month on charges of attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon and other counts in the shooting of a man on his front porch.All three men have now been charged with another felony for the escape.<em>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</em>",
    "2016 - 6944": "DENVER \u2014 Seeking a safe haven in Colorado\u2019s legal marijuana marketplace, illegal drug traffickers are growing weed among the state\u2019s sanctioned pot warehouses and farms, then covertly shipping it elsewhere and pocketing millions of dollars from the sale, according to law enforcement officials and court records consulted by the Associated Press.In one case, the owner of a skydiving business crammed hundreds of pounds of Colorado pot into his planes and flew the weed to Minnesota, where associates allegedly sold it for millions of dollars in cash. In another, a Denver man was charged with sending more than 100 pot-filled FedEx packages to Buffalo, New York, where drug dealers divvied up the shipment. Twenty other drug traffickers, many from Cuba, were accused of relocating to Colorado to grow marijuana that they sent to Florida, where it can fetch more than double the price in a legal Colorado shop.These cases and others confirm a longstanding fear of marijuana opponents that the state\u2019s much-watched experiment in legal pot would invite more illegal trafficking to other states where the drug is still strictly forbidden.One source is Colorado residents or tourists who buy retail pot and take it out of state. But more concerning to authorities are larger-scale traffickers who move here specifically to grow the drug and ship it to more lucrative markets.The trend also bolsters the argument of neighboring Nebraska and Oklahoma, which filed a lawsuit in late 2014 seeking to declare Colorado\u2019s pot legalization unconstitutional, arguing that the move sent a tide of illicit weed across their borders. The Obama administration last month urged the Supreme Court to reject the suit, saying that the leakage was not Colorado\u2019s fault.No one knows exactly how much pot leaves Colorado. When illegal shipments are seized, it\u2019s often impossible to prove where the marijuana was grown. But court documents and interviews with law enforcement officials indicate well-organized traffickers are seeking refuge in Colorado\u2019s flourishing pot industry.\u201cThere\u2019s no question there\u2019s a lot more of this activity than there was two years ago,\u201d said Colorado\u2019s US attorney, John Walsh.Some in the legal industry say police have exaggerated the problem and put unfair scrutiny on people who legally grow pot on behalf of patients. Lawmakers last year limited unregulated pot growers to no more than 99 plants in an effort to crack down on those selling untaxed pot.The federal government allowed Colorado\u2019s experiment on the condition that state officials act to keep marijuana from migrating to places where it is still outlawed and out of the hands of criminal cartels. Federal authorities acknowledge that both things are happening but say that, because the state is trying to keep its industry tightly regulated, there\u2019s no reason to end the legal pot trade.The pot industry also acknowledges the criminal activity and insists it is doing all it can to keep legally grown weed from crossing state lines. Among other safeguards, Colorado law requires growers to get a license and use a \u201cseed-to-sale\u201d tracking system that monitors marijuana plants at every stage.Many of the illicit growers come from elsewhere, never obtain a growing license and \u201cdon\u2019t even attempt to adhere to the law,\u201d said Barbra M. Roach, special agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s Denver field division.\u201cIt\u2019s like hiding in plain sight,\u201d she said.Authorities in Washington state, which also allows recreational marijuana, have noticed more marijuana leaving the state. But more reports are coming from Colorado, which has the nation\u2019s most robust commercial market and an international reputation for producing premium, high-potency pot.\u201cIt\u2019s a brand name now,\u201d Roach said.Jason Warf, head of the Southern Colorado Cannabis Council, said people are \u201ccoming from out of state, buying products from licensed stores and being arrested on their way home.\u201dThat \u201cis really hard to curb,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t essentially babysit adults and their behavior.\u201dThe Colorado Department of Revenue\u2019s marijuana enforcement division cites shops if pot is unaccounted for but \u201cafter it\u2019s sold, we have very little control what happens to the marijuana,\u201d director Lewis Koski said.Police agencies seized nearly 2 tons of Colorado weed from drivers who had intended to take it to 36 other states in 2014, the year legal pot shops opened, according to the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, a federally funded drug task force. By comparison, they seized less than a ton in 2009.US postal inspectors seized about 470 pounds of Colorado pot from the mail in 2014, up from 57 pounds in 2010, according to the task force, whose findings are based on voluntary submissions from law enforcement agencies and are largely anecdotal.<figure class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" id=\"attachment_10042988\"><a class=\"\" href=\"https://vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/01/obama_marijuana.jpg?quality=100&amp;strip=all\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-10042988\" height=\"237\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"https://vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/01/obama_marijuana.jpg?quality=100&amp;strip=all&amp;w=300\" srcset=\"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/01/obama_marijuana.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=600 600w, https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/01/obama_marijuana.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=449 450w, https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/01/obama_marijuana.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=300 300w, https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/01/obama_marijuana.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=150 150w, https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/01/obama_marijuana.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all 1024w\" width=\"300\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"credit\">AP</span></figcaption></figure>Some cases have comic overtones, like when a Wyoming patrolman discovered 7 ounces of high-grade weed in trick-or-treat bags the day after Halloween, or when police in northern Colorado seized stuffed animals full of marijuana destined for Florida.Other operations are more sophisticated, like the one in which authorities say 32 people used skydiving planes and posed as licensed medical marijuana caregivers and small business owners to export tens of thousands of pounds of pot grown in Denver warehouses, usually to Minnesota. The organization made more than $12 million over four years, according to a state indictment.When they busted illegal pot farms in southern Colorado in September, state and federal agents found 28 guns, more than 1,000 plants and $25,000 in cash.A local UPS facility intercepts about 50 pounds of pot headed out of state each week, said Todd Reeves of the Colorado Drug Investigators Association. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the resources,\u201d he said, \u201cto be able to go after every single one of these cases.\u201d",

The escape wasn\u2019t noticed for 16 hours.It was the first escape from the maximum-security lockup in more than 20 years.Ravaghi was taken into custody about an hour before the arrest was announced Thursday afternoon and remained jailed. It was unclear whether she had an attorney.\u2014 Erika Aguilar (@erikaaaguilar) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/erikaaaguilar/status/692866920706510848\">January 29, 2016</a>Ravaghi worked for the Rancho Santiago Community College District and taught English as a second language to inmates at the jail for about six months, sheriff\u2019s Lt. Jeff Hallock said.One of her students was Hossein Nayeri, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2016/01/26/diabolical-inmate-who-escaped-prison-likened-to-hannibal-lecter/\">who was awaiting trial on charges that he kidnapped and tortured a marijuana dispensary owner</a> \u2014 finally cutting off his penis \u2014 in a bid to learn where he might have cached money.\u201cThere was some type of relationship that developed between the two\u201d that was close, Hallock said, but he didn\u2019t know whether it was a romance.Ravaghi denied supplied any tools to the inmates, but investigators suspect she provided Google maps that potentially could have helped the inmates plan their route after fleeing the jail, Hallock said.Sheriff Sandra Hutchens has said that Nayeri, 37, is believed to be the mastermind of the escape.Hallock said investigators believe he and the others \u2014 alleged killer Bac Duong, 43, and Jonathan Tieu, 20 \u2014 are living in a white GMC Savana van that was stolen on Sunday in southern Los Angeles.Duong apparently stole the vehicle from someone after responding to a sales ad and taking it for a test drive, Hallock said. \u201cThey may be driving around and potentially living in the back\u201d of the van, he said.Hallock said the ongoing manhunt has led to about 10 arrests so far in connection with the escape, with several other arrests made in connection with unrelated arrest warrants or probation violations. None of those arrests were of jail employees.The investigation has centered on a Vietnamese gang in the nearby cities of Westminster and Garden Grove with ties to two of the inmates.",
    "2016 - 3856": "SANTA ANA, Calif. \u2014 Police captured one of three fugitive inmates on Friday after they <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2016/01/25/how-three-vicious-criminals-pulled-off-a-hollywood-style-jailbreak/\">escaped a week ago from a California jail</a> while facing charges involving violent crimes.Bac Duong, 43, was arrested by police in Santa Ana, the same city where the trio made their elaborate escape from the Orange County jail, Sheriff Sandra Hutchens said.Duong, Jonathan Tieu, 20, and Hossein Nayeri, 37, had all been awaiting trial for unrelated violent crimes. They were held in a dormitory with about 65 other men in Santa Ana, about 30 miles southeast of Los Angeles.The men escaped early Jan. 22 after cutting a hole in a metal grate, then crawling through plumbing tunnels and onto the roof of a five-story jail building.They pushed aside barbed wire and rappelled down using a rope made of bedsheets.It took jail staff 16 hours to realize the three men were missing because an assault on a guard delayed an evening head count.The escape raised questions about security at the jail in suburban Orange County and resembled a similar breakout last summer at a state prison in upstate New York.In that case, two inmates also cut through a wall that was hidden by a bunk bed and used the hole to access piping and tunnels that led outside.In California, authorities say the trio cut through a quarter-inch-thick grill on a dormitory wall and got into plumbing tunnels before sawing through half-inch-thick steel bars. On the roof, they moved aside razor wire and rappelled to the ground using the bed linen.They were last seen at a 5 a.m. check but were not determined to be missing until 16 hours later, partially because an assault on a guard delayed an evening census.Hutchens, who oversees the jail, has said she was extremely troubled by how long it took to discover the inmates were gone.It was the first escape in nearly three decades from the California facility built in 1968. The jail holds 900 men.Authorities had offered $200,000 in rewards for information leading to their recapture.Tieu had been held on a $1 million bond since October 2013 on charges of murder and attempted murder in the shooting of a man on his front porch. Nayeri had been held without bond since September 2014 on charges of kidnapping, torture, aggravated mayhem and burglary. Authorities alleged that he kidnapped a medical marijuana dealer because he believed the man had hidden a large sum of money.The prosecutor in his case drew criticism from her boss when she compared Nayeri to fictional cannibal killer Hannibal Lecter after the escape.Authorities say Duong has been held without bond since last month on counts of attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon and other charges in a gang shooting.Immigration authorities and records indicate he had been ordered deported to Vietnam in 1998 but remained in the country and racked up a lengthy rap sheet.Nayeri, the probable mastermind in the escape, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2016/01/28/teacher-accused-of-helping-inmates-escape-california-jail/\">had help from a woman whose English classes he was taking while locked up</a>, authorities allege.He came to know Nooshafarin Ravaghi, 44, during an English as a Second Language course inside the Orange County jail.Investigators believe a close relationship developed between the two, who had exchanged handwritten letters of a \u201cpersonal nature,\u201d sheriff\u2019s spokesman Lt. Jeff Hallock said.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the relationship that you would expect between a teacher and an inmate in a custody setting,\u201d he said, noting that jail employees go through training about rules and the risk of being manipulated by inmates.Authorities say Duong stole a van the day after the escape after taking it for a test drive in the only reported sighting of the men since the breakout.",

They then called police, who briefly detained her at Plaza Vista School in Irvine, where she volunteered.Peters testified that she was humiliated as a police officer searched the car as her own daughter watched.\u201cI was crying and begging for him to not put the drugs on the car, because people would see it,\u201d Peters said. \u201cEverybody was looking at me.\u201dShe was questioned for about two hours.Kent Easter, representing himself during the case, argued that Peters was exaggerating her distress in order to reap a financial reward.\u201cThe fact that something really bad was done to a person does not give them a winning Powerball number,\u201d he told the jury.Easter declined comment after the verdict and Jill Easter, who also represented herself, was not present in court for the verdict, the Register said.Peters said the Easters have never shown remorse for their action.\u201cThis was really not about money, this was about standing up to people that pick on other people and telling them it\u2019s not OK to do this,\u201d she said, wiping away tears. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have gone this far had they said they were sorry,\u201d Peters said.In 2014, Kent Easter was convicted of felony false imprisonment.
