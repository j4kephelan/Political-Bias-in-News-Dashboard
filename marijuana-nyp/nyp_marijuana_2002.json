    "2002 - 1271": "Being mayor can be such a drag.  A pro-marijuana group is using a pot-positive quote uttered by Mayor Bloomberg last year, in a new $500,000 ad campaign to be unveiled today.  \u201cGreat. I\u2019m thrilled,\u201d Bloomberg quipped sarcastically yesterday when asked about the ad after a joint press conference with the Fire Department.  Bloomberg bluntly admitted to New York magazine in April 2001 he had smoked marijuana in the past \u2013 and definitely inhaled.  \u201cYou bet I did, and I enjoyed it,\u201d Bloomberg said at the time.  The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws plans to plaster the ads throughout the city, urging the NYPD to stop locking up pot smokers.  \u201cI\u2019m not thrilled they\u2019re using my name,\u201d Bloomberg said yesterday. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s that First Amendment that gets in the way of me stopping it.\u201d  NORML spokesman Nicholas Thimmesch said the group is not trying to embarrass the mayor.  \u201cThis is not, \u2018Gotcha!\u2019 We are very happy that the mayor expressed his experience with marijuana and said it in a favorable light. We\u2019re saying, \u2018At last, an honest politician,\u2019 \u201d he said.  The Washington-based group wants the NYPD to stop cuffing and jailing people caught with less than 28 grams of pot.  The users should get only a citation instead, Thimmesch said. ",
    "2002 - 2123": "<strong>L</strong>IKE Mayor Bloomberg, former President Bill Clinton, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, former Rep. Newt Gingrich, Gov. Pataki, and others I can\u2019t remember, much less care about, I\u2019ve smoked marijuana.  Unlike many of these prominent party animals, I didn\u2019t like it.  Pot propelled me to manically clean my dorm room at SUNY New Paltz, then crouch behind locked doors until imaginary cops left the building.  And then, there was that unfortunate incident involving Twinkies and ketchup . . .  The nice folks at NORML, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, came to New York yesterday to make trouble.  For one thing, NORML hid its press conference in a tiny, sweltering upstairs room at the New York Sheraton, leaving drug-addled members of the media no instructions how to find the party.  Worse, these earnest pot-pushing Washingtonites left their senses of humor on the Delta shuttle.  Worse yet, they provided no munchies.  (A colleague complained that they provided no samples.)  For 30 years, the graying gasbags of NORML have pushed to decriminalize recreational use and possession of marijuana.  In their quest to save fellow cannabis aficionados from the indignation of a night in the slammer, they\u2019ve found an unwitting champion: Mayor Bloomberg, who was once quoted as saying he \u201cenjoyed\u201d the weed.  Now, the NORML jokers are threatening to plaster his picture on buses and telephone booths, as if to tell New Yorkers it\u2019s OK to get high.  Getting serious for a just a moment, the NORML folks got a tad agitated when I asked about those rival ads from the federal government, which say that when you buy marijuana, your money goes to terrorists. They say it doesn\u2019t.  Worse was when I asked if they carried any pot in their pockets.  \u201cDo you?\u201d shot back an indignant Dr. John Morgan, illustrating the drug\u2019s paranoia-inducing side effect.  I had no pot. But I was desperate for a snack.  The guy beside me was jonesing for a joint.  All of which made me miss Rudy Giuliani.  He would have tossed these troublemakers out on the pavement. And maybe even provided pretzels.",
    "2002 - 957": "Mayor Bloomberg said yesterday he regrets telling a magazine last year he tried and \u201cenjoyed\u201d marijuana \u2013 but he added that he always tells the truth.  \u201cI never lie. So, if somebody asked me a question, I told them. Do I in retrospect wish I didn\u2019t say it that day, so they couldn\u2019t quote me? Of course,\u201d Bloomberg said.  The quote \u2013 \u201cYou bet I did, and I enjoyed it\u201d \u2013 is splashed across new ads urging the city to stop arresting and jailing marijuana users.  The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ran a full-page ad (right) in The New York Times yesterday and unveiled plans to run ads on phone booths and 75 buses for a month and on AM radio stations for a week.  The ads star a smiling Bloomberg with the quote appearing above his head in a comic-book-style word bubble.  \u201cThe vast majority of the tens of millions of marijuana smokers are good people \u2026 they are certainly not criminals,\u201d NORML executive director Keith Stroup said.",

The group is pushing Bloomberg to stop arresting casual pot smokers \u2013 the policy under former Mayor Giuliani \u2013 and instead give them tickets. But the poke at Bloomberg\u2019s wild youth may not work.   \u201cI am a believer that we should enforce the laws and I do not think that decriminalizing marijuana is a good idea,\u201d the mayor said.",
    "2002 - 2043": "Mayor Bloomberg last night said he\u2019ll \u201cprobably\u201d seek a second term at City Hall in 2005 \u2013 his strongest hint about his political plans since he took office.  \u201cI probably will run for re-election \u2013 everybody that\u2019s ever been in my situation has done that,\u201d Bloomberg told PBS talk-show host Charlie Rose.  The neophyte politician \u2013 who celebrated his first 100 days in office Wednesday \u2013 spoke amid swirling speculation that he\u2019ll pack it in after one term.  Bloomberg scored his surprise win over Democrat Mark Green in his first-ever bid for office.  But the billionaire mayor, who left his media empire to run the city, insisted that getting re-elected isn\u2019t his main priority right now.  \u201cPeople say, \u2018Well, why don\u2019t you declare now,'\u201d the mayor said.  \u201cNo. I\u2019m gonna do the best I can for four years, and I\u2019m not gonna worry about whether [what I do is] popular or not . . . I\u2019m not gonna worry about the polls, I\u2019m not gonna worry about the editorial pages.  \u201cI\u2019m not running for re-election today . . . And if I want to run for re-election, if I\u2019ve done a good job, I\u2019ll be very successful,\u201d Bloomberg added.  \u201cAnd if I haven\u2019t, all of the pandering isn\u2019t going to be worth anything.\u201d  Bloomberg also insisted he\u2019s \u201cloving\u201d the job.  In the hourlong interview with Rose, who acknowledged he\u2019s socially friendly with Bloomberg, the mayor also:  * Lavished praise on former Mayor Rudy Giuliani, saying he\u2019s helped him screen appointees and said comparisons of their styles \u201caren\u2019t fair.\u201d  \u201cI think on balance he did a great job,\u201d Bloomberg said.  * In another first, Bloomberg acknowledged spending a weekend at his Bermuda home \u2013 but said, \u201cI\u2019ve been there once since I got elected.\u201d  Media reports have put Bloomberg at his Bermuda home twice since his election.  Bloomberg has made headlines for refusing to say where he spends his weekends, or whether he or a deputy is running the city when he has no public schedule.  * Bloomberg again fended off questions about a pro-marijuana group using an old quote of his in an advertisement.",
    "2002 - 5722": "THE city is going to pot! Or maybe it\u2019s just the mayor.  Last week, Mayor Bloomberg, who spends more time in the subway than a homeless man, saw himself coming and going. Unfortunately, where he saw himself mostly was in posters for NORML, the pro-pot PAC. Along with his picture in the ad is a quote he gave to a New York magazine reporter who\u2019d asked him if he\u2019d ever smoked ganja, mon. \u201cYou bet I did. And I enjoyed it,\u201d he said.  This, of course, enraged every self-righteous do-gooder who then immediately went on every TV show that would have them declaring how horrible it all was. Right.  Meantime, I\u2019d like everyone who grew up in post-WWII America who got through college without going one toke over the line at least once to please stand up. Oh, please. Stop lying. Especially you with the bad haircut in the back row \u2013 sit right back down. You did it, you know you did it, and you inhaled it, too.  Sheesh, it\u2019s not like demon weed exactly ruined his Blooming life \u2013 or his career. On the contrary, he\u2019s built one of the most gigantic financial empires of recent times, he\u2019s raised good kids and, hell, he even gets along with his ex-wife. I mean, we\u2019re not talking Marion Barry here.  Like every smart guy who didn\u2019t come up in politics, Bloomberg knows the truth is like a good shower \u2013 the minute you come clean, the stink goes away. And it did in this case, too. Well, until I just raked all the muck back up again, that is.<strong>PASS THE $1B COLLECTION BASKET</strong>  NOW that we\u2019ve got all precincts reporting in, the bad news is that every big city \u2013 and God knows how many small towns \u2013 have been slimed by pedophile priests, and the bishops who love them. We\u2019ve got New York, we\u2019ve got Boston, Detroit, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Los Angeles, Chicago, and San Francisco, to name just a few.  Is this a church or some weird sex cult? All that\u2019s missing is David Koresh and Jim Jones. Even snake-oil salesman-sermonizer Jim Bakker had enough sense to have sex with a grown woman, not a child.  The church fathers keep emphasizing that it\u2019s only a tiny percentage of priests who\u2019ve preyed on kids. Right. Meantime, there are an estimated 2,000 priests involved in sex-abuse cases \u2013 but there are only 31,000 diocesan priests listed in the whole country. Almost 6 percent is tiny? Only if it\u2019s the APR on your credit card.  The wages of sin? It\u2019s estimated the church has paid out $1 billion in hush money, oh sorry, settlements to victims since 1985 alone. A billion isn\u2019t tiny, either \u2013 even if you\u2019ve got more bucks than a Bloomberg.  Nevertheless, the cover-ups \u2013 and worse, the arrogance \u2013 continue unabated. Take Cardinal Law(less) of Boston. He says he won\u2019t step down \u2013 no matter how many parishioners call for his head. Step down? He should be tossed out on his miter, and then tossed in jail for covering up for all those bums.  And then there\u2019s NYC \u2013 where we\u2019re all supposed to stand up and cheer because Cardinal Egan finally handed over a bunch of old sex-abuse cases to authorities. What is this, the Valachi Papers with perps who are already dead or in the witless protection program? (In the church, it\u2019s called a transfer.) How about handing over all the current cases of priests who are still alive, preaching and preying on their knees?  It\u2019s time for the Catholic Church to come clean, literally and figuratively. Didn\u2019t these holy men learn anything from the scandals of Presidents Nixon and Clinton? It\u2019s the cover-up more than the crime that lays you low, brother.  Rudy pitches  OLD politicians never fade away \u2013 they become consultants, experts on everything, bazillionaire authors and traveling guests who spend an inordinate amount of time throwing out first pitches and pitching their pasts.  Last week, Rudy, who looks like he\u2019s hit more buffet tables than fastballs since leaving City Hall, pitched balls and himself. Monday, he threw the bull, and on Tuesday he threw the ball.  Unfortunately, the man who would brook no bull from others told the spellbound audience in Washington the exact same true story he\u2019d told an equally rapt audience in Akron, Ohio, in March \u2013 almost.  In Akron, he said he saw Joe Namath getting frisked at the Super Bowl by security.  In D.C., the Joe he said he saw getting searched at the Super Bowl was Montana.  I don\u2019t blame him. I\u2019d rather watch Joe Montana get body-searched, too.<strong>CITY INFLICTING WATER TORTURE ON US</strong>  AS usual, the city is overreacting to the underwhelming amount of rain we\u2019ve had this year. They\u2019re demanding ornamental fountains be turned off \u2013 even when they use recycled water. The reason is unreasonable. They fear the public perception is that fountains waste water \u2013 even if they don\u2019t. Not a good move. In 1989, the city tried the same thing, but Sage Realty took the city to court \u2013 and the city lost. Perception, it was ruled, has nothing to do with reality.  Speaking of reality and perception, the best thing since the drought hit are the signs DEP put up in public restrooms that read: \u201cReport leaks . . .\u201d They\u2019re kidding \u2013 right?<strong>THIS E-MAIL CASTS MAGIC MISSPELL</strong>  FROM OCavey: \u201cThe way you compared the Ku Ku Klan to the Hamas suicide bombers because of the similarity of their clothes is beyond belief. It\u2019s like saying that you are a journalist jut because your write for a newspaper. I feel sorry for you.\u201d (At least I know how to use spell-check.)  From Vincentmarmorale: \u201cYou\u2019ve got it right. The KKK picture was on the mark. You have the courage to write the truth which is lacking with most media members who have the courage of a bowl of jelly.\u201d  From Al ResnicK: \u201cAre you originally from Brooklyn?\u201d (Isn\u2019t everyone?)  From Joeryr: \u201cAre you fat?\u201d (Isn\u2019t everyone?)",
    "2002 - 2955": " A supercolony of ants, stretching thousands of miles from the Italian Riviera to northwest Spain, has been discovered.  It\u2019s the largest such unit ever recorded, according to Swiss, French and Danish scientists, whose findings appear in today\u2019s issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.  The colony consists of billions of Argentine ants living in millions of nests whose members cooperate with one another.  Normally, ants from different nests fight. But the researchers concluded that ants in the supercolony were all close enough genetically to recognize one another, despite being from different nests with different queens.  Cooperation allows the colonies to develop at much higher densities than normal, eliminating 90 percent of other types of ants that live near them. (s, lcf)  ****  Police in Maine tackled a suspect with the help of a skunk who sprayed the perp in the face.  The 32-year-old man had tried to escape by running into woods in Lewiston.  But the shock of the skunk attack was enough to slow him down and let police catch up.  \u201cThe scent was powerful enough to pretty much incapacitate him. Sometimes we get help from where we don\u2019t expect it,\u201d said Lt. Tom Avery.  Authorities have now nicknamed the heroic beast Officer Pepe LePew and may make him an honorary police officer.  The smelly suspect was wanted for violating release conditions stemming from a domestic assault.  ****  An upstate landlord \u2013 furious that pushers are selling cocaine and marijuana from his building \u2013 hung a sign outside reading: \u201cWe have drugs. Come on in.\u201d  \u201cThe neighbors said there\u2019s been much less activity, although there\u2019s still some,\u201d said Stephen Menz.  But authorities in Binghamton are insisting Menz take the sign down while they try to solve the problem.  \u201cThe property should not be turned into an eyesore,\u201d city spokesman Rich David said.  \u201cWhen you shine a spotlight on a rat, it runs,\u201d Menz explains.  As a result, his neighbors have started their own grassroots movement.  Around the corner, a pair of neat signs gracing a front porch read: \u201cNo stopping. No standing. No sitting. Stay off our porch.\u201d   Weedkiller is turning male frogs into bisexual freaks, researchers say.   The frogs are developing multiple sex organs, sometimes both male and female, after exposure to Atrazine, the most common weedkiller in North America.   And, chillingly, it can be found in rainwater, snow runoff and groundwater.   \u201cThere is virtually no atrazine-free environment,\u201d said Tyrone Hayes of the University of California at Berkeley.   The Environmental Protection Agency permits up to 3 parts per billion of atrazine in drinking water. But Hayes\u2019 team found it affected frogs at doses as small as 0.1 part per billion.   As the amount increased, up to 20 percent of frogs exposed during their early development produced multiple sex organs or had both male and female organs. Many had small, feminized larnynxes.

    "2002 - 1225": "A 38-year-old construction worker with an arsenal of illegal weapons was busted early yesterday when cops armed with a search warrant raided his East Harlem apartment and seized a cache of 38 guns, police said.  James Ellenberger, 38, was asleep when cops assigned to the Intelligence Division, the Housing Bureau and the Emergency Service Unit converged on his 116th Street apartment to carry out an early-morning raid, said Capt. Mark Pagano.  Ellenberger, a day laborer who lives alone, was handcuffed without incident after ESU cops secured the apartment and found 20 handguns, 12 rifles and six shotguns. One of the guns was reported stolen in Pennsylvania, said Pagano.  Also seized were 15 knives, two sets of karate fighting sticks, an assortment of ammunition, and a small quantity of marijuana, he said.  \u201cHis explanation right now . . . is that [they] were his grandfather\u2019s \u2013 they were his down south,\u201d said Pagano. \u201cWe have not been able to verify that, although we have been able to verify that neither [he nor] his grandfather is a licensed gun dealer.\u201d  The raid stemmed from an earlier arrest by Housing cops of a suspect charged with domestic violence who decided to cooperate during a debriefing, he said.
