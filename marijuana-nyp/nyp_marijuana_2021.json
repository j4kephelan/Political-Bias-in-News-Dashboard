It focuses on providing drug users with treatment through newly funded addiction recovery centers.\u201cToday, the first domino of our cruel and inhumane war on drugs has fallen,setting off what we expect to be a cascade of other efforts centering health over criminalization,\u201d Kassandra Frederique, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, told the Associated Press.The law was not without opposition.

Then, in 2014, recreational marijuana became legal in Oregon.<em>With Post wires </em>",
