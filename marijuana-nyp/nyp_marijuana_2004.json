    "2004 - 2178": "When the government\u2019s star witness at the Martha Stewart trial takes the stand this week, he\u2019ll be grilled over a series of catty e-mails he wrote about the domestic diva, The Post has learned.  With the trial resuming today, government prosecutors have appealed to Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum to allow Douglas Faneuil to begin his testimony as soon as possible, sources said.  He was supposed to take the stand last week, but Cedarbaum put his testimony on hold until Thursday after ruling the government had withheld an important FBI document from the defense.  More documents were sent to the defense on Friday and over the weekend \u2013 a development the defense will use to argue that it should be given as much time as possible to prepare for Faneuil\u2019s testimony.  Sources have revealed that when Faneuil is cross-examined, he will be peppered with questions over a batch of e-mails he sent from his Merrill Lynch office to boyfriend Robert Haskell in the fall of 2001 \u2013 just weeks before he handled Stewart\u2019s fateful ImClone stock sale.  Faneuil, 28, who was working for Stewart\u2019s broker, Peter Bacanovic, wrote in the e-mails that Stewart was often mean to him when she contacted the office, one source said.   Describing himself as \u201cBaby,\u201d Faneuil told Haskell in one e-mail that Stewart had treated him badly, but \u201cBaby\u201d got back at her, the source said. Stewart\u2019s team will cross-examine Faneuil about the e-mails in a bid to show jurors that he may have an ax to grind.  The language used in the emails was described as \u201cbitchy\u201d by one source.  Stewart lawyer Robert Morvillo also wants to cross-examine Faneuil about his admission to the FBI that he used \u201cecstasy\u201d and marijuana before and after he began cooperating with the government.  But the government has filed confidential legal papers with Cedarbaum, arguing that such questions should be off-limits, sources said.  Lawyers for Faneuil could not be reached for comment last night.  Faneuil\u2019s credibility is critical to the government\u2019s case against Stewart and Bacanovic, who are standing trial on charges they obstructed the feds\u2019 insider-trading investigation into her sale of almost 4,000 ImClone shares.",
    "2004 - 3286": "The man accused of being the vicious East Side rapist has a staggering 27 arrests on his rap sheet \u2013 but has never spent more than six months behind bars.   From October 1989 to November 2002, Larry White, 34, was convicted 25 times for crimes ranging from fare-beating to peddling pot to weapons possession, NYPD records show.   White was also arrested in the alleged rape of a Brooklyn call girl in 1998, but officials yesterday did not know the disposition of that case. Another lesser charge was dismissed, too.   But in the other 25 arrests, White, charged with four sexual attacks and robberies last week, copped a plea and received sentences mostly ranging from conditional discharge to 60 days in the slammer.   His stiffest penalty was six months behind bars for weapons possession. He pleaded guilty to the charge, a Class D felony, after his arrest Sept. 10, 2000.   Weapons possession appears to be the only felony among the 27 arrests. The rest are misdemeanors. Twenty-five of the arrests occurred in Manhattan and two in Brooklyn.   The laissez-faire way the courts dealt with White is not unusual.   A law-enforcement official said it often happens because state law doesn\u2019t allow increasing penalties for criminals who repeatedly commit misdemeanors.   \u201cThe law doesn\u2019t permit giving stiffer penalties for repeat misdemeanor offenses. It only permits sentencing offenders to the max, which very often isn\u2019t more than a year,\u201d the official said.   To deal with the problem, the state Office of Court Administration set up the persistent-offenders\u2019 court about 18 months ago.   \u201cClearly, this type of scenario presents a problem for the criminal-justice system, which is why we have a persistent-misdemeanor court,\u201d said David Bookstaver, a spokesman for the office.   \u201cIt would have raised a red flag on this type of defendant.\u201d   White, who gave his father\u2019s Queens home as his address, was arrested in Union City, N.J., Saturday after one of his victims identified him from a photo array, police said.   Cops then traced him to Union City, where he was staying with a female friend.   The victim, a 23-year-old Upper East Side woman, who was robbed Jan. 24, came forward only after learning of his second attack \u2013 the robbery and sexual assault of a 19-year-old woman Tuesday, cops said.   White struck again Thursday, police said, sexually assaulting a 25-year-old man and then forcing him to go to an ATM machine to withdraw money.   A day later, White grabbed a 24-year-old woman\u2019s pocketbook and fondled her, but she hit him over the head with the bag and he fled empty-handed, cops said.   White was also charged with robbing a transvestite of $600 on the Lower East Side on Oct. 16. Sources said he admitted committing the crime.

    "2004 - 2276": "A Manhattan teen plans to file suit against the probation officer he claims \u201ccoerced\u201d him into having sex romps with her and wrote him a letter encouraging him to grow up to be a \u201ccollegiate thug.\u201d  The teen, whose name is being withheld, has filed papers in Manhattan Supreme Court announcing his intention to sue the city, the Probation Department and Nicole Waite, the officer he says he was pressured into having illicit trysts with last May while she handled his marijuana case.  The teen\u2019s court papers say as a result of those romps, he\u2019s endured \u201cfear, humiliation, injury to his reputation, suffering and severe emotional trauma.\u201d  Waite, a 12-year Probation veteran, \u201ccoerced him into having sex with her. This is not something he wanted to do,\u201d said his lawyer, Jonathan Ginsberg. \u201cThe city allowed this to happen on their watch \u2013 allowing a city official to engage in this kind of gross misconduct on city property. She was encouraging criminality. She\u2019s a thug. How could they not detect this?\u201d  Waite, 37, who maintains she was \u201cset up,\u201d is to stand trial on bribe-receiving and misconduct charges next week for the alleged trysts. Prosecutors charge she propositioned the teen, then 17, while working on his pre-sentencing report, and they then had three sex encounters \u2013 one in the city Probation office in Manhattan Criminal Court. They allegedly smoked pot together during their third tryst.  Waite also allegedly wrote him a letter, included with the teen\u2019s court filing, that didn\u2019t exactly encourage him to straighten up and fly right.  \u201cYou told me that you pretty much have your life planned out \u2013 you plan to be involved in criminal activities until you\u2019re 55,\u201d says the letter, which encourages he be more \u201ccollegiate thug\u201d than \u201cstreet smart n- \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 -.\u201d  \u201cYou see sweetie, \u2018good girls\u2019 like their men smart, but we don\u2019t want no bitch-ass n- \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 -s either,\u201d the letter advises.  Ginsberg said his client was initially scared to report her \u201cbecause she had his home address and a badge,\u201d but did so after his case was resolved.  The court filing doesn\u2019t say how much cash the teen is seeking. Waite\u2019s lawyer, Edward Wilford, who contends his client was \u201cset up,\u201d said the teen\u2019s intention to sue \u201cspeaks to what this case may be all about\u201d \u2013 money.",
    "2004 - 2293": "Former Merrill Lynch rookie broker Doug Faneuil admitted to jurors yesterday he used cocaine, marijuana and \u201cecstasy.\u201d  He was forced to \u2018fess up about his drug use after Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum ruled defense lawyers could ask limited questions about his after-dark indulgences.  Faneuil, 28, admitted to the jury he\u2019d told the feds during confidential interviews that he\u2019d experimented with \u201cmany types of drugs,\u201d including the club drug Special K \u2013 ketamine, which is an anesthetic.  He also revealed that only days after handling Martha Stewart\u2019s contentious ImClone trade, he popped an ecstasy pill to celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve 2002.  But he said that since the New Year\u2019s party, he\u2019d only smoked marijuana.  When asked if he\u2019d ever used drugs while on the job at Merrill Lynch, he said, \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d  While some jurors pursed their lips as Faneuil reeled off his drugs of choice, others appeared miffed he was being grilled about the sensitive subject.  Lawyers for Stewart and Bacanovic had pressed the judge to question him in front of the jury about an admission he made to the FBI that he\u2019d smoked pot after signing his government cooperation agreement.  Before the jury entered the courtroom, Faneuil told Cedarbaum he\u2019d smoked pot over a \u201ctwo- or three-day\u201d vacation in Jamaica in April 2003 \u2013 more than six months after he signed the agreement.  Stewart lawyer Robert Morvillo said Faneuil had clearly violated the terms of the agreement in which he\u2019d promised not to break any laws.  Faneuil said he\u2019d assumed pot was legal in Jamaica because of the \u201cubiquity\u201d of its use there.  The judge ruled the Jamaica trip was off limits, saying Faneuil could only be questioned to assess whether he was cooperating with the feds to avoid being prosecuted for drug use.  Faneuil also told the judge he\u2019d used ecstasy \u201ctwo or three times\u201d during his employment with Merrill between June 2001 and his suspension and dismissal 12 months later.  \u201cIt intensifies your tactile sensations and emotions,\u201d he said.  He said he\u2019d bought the ecstasy at a dance club, but he couldn\u2019t remember how much it cost.  He was also asked about correspondence he\u2019d sent his friend Robert Haskell regarding the drug crystal meth.  Faneuil told Bacanovic lawyer David Apfel he never used crystal meth. ",
    "2004 - 3147": "Three St. John\u2019s University varsity basketball players were suspended yesterday after a woman they met in a postgame visit to a Pittsburgh strip club cried rape, officials said.   Pittsburgh police said they were investigating the shocking charges that members of the Red Storm sexually assaulted the 38-year-old woman at the Westin Convention Center Hotel after the hapless, last-place team\u2019s 71-51 loss to the University of Pittsburgh Wednesday night.   The woman told cops she met the players at the Club Erotica in McKees Rocks, Pa., about 2:30 a.m. yesterday.   The university identified the three suspended hoopsters as 6-foot guard Elijah Ingram, 6-foot-10 center Abe Keita, and 6-foot-7 forward/center Grady Reynolds.   Reynolds faced criminal charges in 2002 for allegedly assaulting a swimmer at the school.   All three were suspended as the police and university probe the allegations. Sources said two other players also visited the strip club and would likely be suspended.   The school, which cited \u201crules violations\u201d and \u201cbehavior inconsistent with St. John\u2019s mission and values\u201d as the reason for the suspensions, will now have to hold tryouts to replace the missing team members and have enough players for their next game Sunday, a team source said.   Police would not comment on details of the case.   A source close to the team said someone may have recorded the incident on Ingram\u2019s video-equipped cell phone. The source claimed the encounter turned ugly after the players got into a dispute with the woman.   None of the suspended players could be reached for comment.   But Reynolds\u2019 mother, Shan Reynolds, told the Post from her home in Alabama: \u201cHe\u2019s doing fine. The truth is going to come to light just like the other time.\u201d   The \u201cother time\u201d was the Nov. 17, 2002, alleged attack on fellow student Rachel Seager, a swimmer at the school who was injured when she said Reynolds threw her against a bathroom wall, smashed her head and tossed her to the ground.   Reynolds was charged with misdemeanor assault and faced a year in prison. But he managed to dodge jail time and continue playing on the team by agreeing to a deal in which he would take anger management classes and perform five hours of community service in return for the charges being dismissed.   Reynolds\u2019 lawyer, Oscar Holt, said that the previous charges would have no affect on any new charges because the assault case was finally dropped last month.   The assault case against Reynolds wasn\u2019t the only legal trouble to plague the team \u2013 which has been struggling in last place in the Big East.   Earlier this season, the squad bounced senior starter Willie Shaw, who was busted for marijuana possession last November.   This week\u2019s rape allegation left St. John\u2019s fans dismayed.   \u201cThis is a severe blow,\u201d said sophomore Jo Anne Luberis. \u201cWhether it\u2019s alleged or not, it\u2019s always going to be associated with the school.\u201d   \u201cWe\u2019re losing players left and right to criminal issues,\u201d said junior Emio Tumeoni.   \u201cI came here because it was a basketball school and it\u2019s unfortunate that it will taint the university.\u201d  Additional reporting by Nick Parish ",
